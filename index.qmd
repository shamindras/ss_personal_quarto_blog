Hi - Iâ€™m **Shamindra Shrotriya** (he/him)!

I'm a __Principal AI Solution Architect__ in the __Retail Intelligence
Team__ at Walmart.

Prior to that I was a teaching faculty for the [CMU Summer Undergraduate
Research Program](https://cmu-sure-2023.netlify.app) (SURE 2023). I co-led a
[fantastic team](https://cmu-sure-2023.netlify.app/people) and taught [advanced
data science concepts](https://cmu-sure-2023.netlify.app/schedule) to talented
and [diverse scholars](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/summerbridge/) selected
nationally. I enjoyed developing a [new data engineering
course](https://cmu-sure-2023.netlify.app/schedule#data-engineering) in the
process. Here is my inclusive [approach to teaching](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/shamindra-shrotriya_teaching-statement.pdf){target="\_blank"}.

I received my PhD from the [Department of Statistics and Data
Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2022. I
was extremely fortunate to be advised by [Matey
Neykov](http://mateyneykov.com/).

This is my personal website which contains information about my
[research](https://www.shamindras.com/research.html){target="\_blank"}. I'd
recommend starting there to get an idea of the type of problems that I really
enjoy working on.

I also have fun writing a
[blog](https://www.shamindras.com/posts.html){target="\_blank"} about various
topics of interest in statistics and machine learning.

You can also learn more about me from my
[CV](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/shamindra-shrotriya_resume.pdf){target="\_blank"},
and [open-source
software](https://www.shamindras.com/software.html){target="\_blank"}
contributions.

Please browse around, and feel free to get in touch for any collaborations.
