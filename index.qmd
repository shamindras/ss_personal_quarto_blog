Hi - I’m **Shamindra** (he/him). 

I'm a final year PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Data
Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon
University. I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by [Matey Neykov](http://mateyneykov.com/).

This is my personal website which contains information about my
[research](https://www.shamindras.com/research.html){target="_blank"}. I'd recommend
starting there to get an idea of the type of problems that I really enjoy
working on.

I also have fun writing a 
[blog](https://www.shamindras.com/posts.html){target="_blank"} 
about various topics of interest in statistics and machine learning.

You can also learn more about me from my
[CV](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/CV.pdf){target="_blank"},
[résumé](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/resume.pdf){target="_blank"},
and [open-source
software](https://www.shamindras.com/software.html){target="_blank"}
contributions.

<!-- Please browse around, and feel free to get in touch for any collaborations. -->

__NOTE: I'm on the industry job market.__ _I'm open to any research-focused
data science role working on large-scale problems with motivated teams. Please
reach out with any suitable opportunities using the contact info in my CV and
resume._
