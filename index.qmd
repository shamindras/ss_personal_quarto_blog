Hi - I’m **Shamindra**! 

I am fortunate to be a graduate student in the
[Department of Statistics and Data
Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/){target="_blank"} at Carnegie Mellon
University.

This is my personal website which contains information about my
[research](https://www.shamindras.com/research.html){target="_blank"}, and also
where I [blog](https://www.shamindras.com/posts.html){target="_blank"} about
various topics of interest in statistics and machine learning. I'd recommend
starting there to get an idea of the type of problems that I really enjoy
working on.

You can also find out a more about me from
[CV](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/CV.pdf){target="_blank"} and
[resumè](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/resume.pdf){target="_blank"}.

Please browse around, and feel free to get in touch for any collaborations. I 
really enjoy meeting new people, and applying statistics to new domains.
