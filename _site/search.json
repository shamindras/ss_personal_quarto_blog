I wrote this meta blogpost in my own words so that I can personally remember the details going forward. I also added more details on deployment with Google Domains and Netlify that would hopefully be useful to new R users waiting to deploy a similar distill blog.\nAdmittedly this blogpost is verbose, but hopefully the details help users new to the distill blogging package."

You can omit this if you don’t want the option to have github pages as your host in the future. I will be using Netlify to host my blog (see below), but it is good to have an additional host option in the future.\nMy local distill blog directory now looked like this (again after running the tree command in the terminal):\n.\n├── .git\n├── .gitignore\n├── .nojekyll\n├── README.md\n├── _posts\n├── _site.yml\n├── about.Rmd\n├── docs\n├── index.Rmd\n└── ss_personal_distill_blog.Rproj\nPretty cool!

There are a bunch of javascript related files automatically generated in the _posts/welcome/welcome_files directory but these don’t need to be altered by the user. I just needed to modify welcome.Rmd contents per my preference as with any regular Rmd file and click Knit in RStudio to refresh it. We can see this in the _posts directory:\n./_posts/welcome\n├── welcome.Rmd\n├── welcome.html\n└── welcome_files\nOne thing that slightly bothered me is that the default welcome blogpost has no date prefix in the directory. This would be nice to have in order to sort all future blogposts chronologically. I could’ve modified this default welcome blogpost Rmd and directory to include the date prefix manually. For simplicity I opted to delete the default welcome directory altogether and recreated it with the date prefix as I prefer as detailed below.\nTo delete the default welcome directory, I just ran the following code at my terminal:\n\nrm -rf _posts/welcome\n\nNote: ⚠️ Always be careful using rm -rf\nWith the default welcome blogpost deleted, I created my own custom welcome blogpost as follows:\n\ndistill::create_post(title = \"Welcome to Shamindra’s Blog\",\n                     author = \"Shamindra Shrotriya\",\n                     date_prefix = TRUE)\n\nNow the welcome blogpost has this nice date prefix structure since we passed this option as TRUE. Let’s see what the _posts directory looks like now\n_posts/2019-07-10-welcome-to-shamindras-blog\n└── welcome-to-shamindras-blog.Rmd`\nNeat - just how I like it! I then modified the content of the new welcome blogpost by going to the following file:\n_posts/2019-06-21-welcome-to-shamindras-blog/welcome-to-shamindras-blog.Rmd\nI modified the contents and then knitted the Rmd file once done to refresh and save the contents.\nNow I had locally created my first personalized content, a simple welcome post 😎.\nMy welcome blog entry can be found here for reference."

Looks like my site name on Netlify is goofy-babbage-7f05c8. Cute, though I’ll personalize by clicking the Change Site Name button. I changed it to ss-personal-distill-blog for my easy reference.\nI clicked the Build and Deploy button next and after clicking the Edit Settings button modified the Publish directory to be _site as shown below:\n\n\nSetup Continuous Deployment with Netlify\n\n\nThis is where all our blogposts in our github repo will be rendered to html by distill once we knit them. Netlify will just pick them up from here everytime you refresh them and deploy our website accordingly\nNext I need to manage the domain i.e. tell Netlify to deploy my site on the custom domain I just purchased from Google Domains.\n\n\nCustomize Site Domains with Netlify\n\n\nAfter clicking verify we have the following domains now set, with www.shamindras.com being the primary domain.\n\n\nAll Custom Domains for Site with Netlify\n\n\nNetlify also tells me that the truncated url shamindras.com will also get routed to the blog. So I don’t event need to write the www. going forward. Thanks Netlify 🙇‍♀."

    "text": "Based on a fun conversation with my statistics cohort over dinner we got to discussing the famous Oxford Comma (or Serial Comma depending on your persuasion). I’ve never really adopted the use but my friends made a compelling argument on it’s apparent general lack of ambiguity when applied appropriately.\nWe will use the Oxford comma on the famously ambiguous phrase (here used without the Oxford Comma before leaves):\n\nEats, shoots and leaves\n\nAfter adding in the Oxford Comma this would become:\n\nEats, shoots, and leaves\n\nGoal: A fun experiment would be to generate all permutations of this phrase with and without the Oxford Comma using R and specifically the tidyverse packages.\n\nFirst, let’s load our required packages.\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\n\nLet’s also define our unique global word values used to construct the required phrases:\n\nWORD_VALS <- c(\"eats\", \"shoots\", \"leaves\")\n\nGenerate all unique 3-word permutations without replacement from the three unique words. We’ll create a helper function to check that a vector of words is unique.\n\nis_unq_perm <- function(word1, word2, word3){\n    words_vec <- c(word1, word2, word3)\n    return(length(words_vec) - length(unique(words_vec)) == 0)\n}\n\nWe can now simply generate every possible triple with replacement using the tidyr::crossing function. We proceed to filter these \\(3^3 = 27\\) triples for unique triples using our is_unq_perm helper function applied row-by-row using purrr::pmap_lgl. The _lgl simply returns a TRUE/FALSE logical value as intended by the applied function.\nNote: The tidyr::crossing generates a Cartesian product of all the 3 word triples, very handy\n\n# Generate the unique word-triples\nall_perms <- tidyr::crossing(word1 = WORD_VALS,\n                             word2 = WORD_VALS,\n                             word3 = WORD_VALS) %>%\n                mutate(.data = .,\n                       is_unq_perm = purrr::pmap_lgl(.l = .,\n                                                     is_unq_perm)) %>%\n                filter(.data = ., is_unq_perm) %>%\n                select(-is_unq_perm)\n\n# Display output in a nice centered table\nall_perms %>%\n  kable(x = ., align = 'c',\n        col.names = c(\"Word 1\",\n                      \"Word 2\",\n                      \"Word 3\"))\n\n\n\nWord 1\nWord 2\nWord 3\n\n\n\neats\nleaves\nshoots\n\n\neats\nshoots\nleaves\n\n\nleaves\neats\nshoots\n\n\nleaves\nshoots\neats\n\n\nshoots\neats\nleaves\n\n\nshoots\nleaves\neats\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat - that part is done! Now we just need to generate for each triple of words an oxford comma and non-oxford comma version. This is done easily using the amazing glue package as seen below:\n\nexprs <- all_perms %>%\n          mutate(non_oxford_comma =\n                   glue_data(.x = .,\n                             \"{word1}, {word2} and {word3}\"),\n                 oxford_comma =\n                   glue_data(.x = .,\n                             \"{word1}, {word2}, and {word3}\")) %>%\n          select(non_oxford_comma, oxford_comma)\n\nWe can display the side-by-side output of the Non-Oxford Comma vs. Oxford comma for the \\(6\\) generated triples as follows:\n\n# Display output in a nice centered table\nexprs %>%\n  kable(x = .,\n        align = 'c',\n        col.names = c(\"Non-Oxford Comma\",\n                      \"Oxford Comma\"))\n\n\n\nNon-Oxford Comma\nOxford Comma\n\n\n\neats, leaves and shoots\neats, leaves, and shoots\n\n\neats, shoots and leaves\neats, shoots, and leaves\n\n\nleaves, eats and shoots\nleaves, eats, and shoots\n\n\nleaves, shoots and eats\nleaves, shoots, and eats\n\n\nshoots, eats and leaves\nshoots, eats, and leaves\n\n\nshoots, leaves and eats\nshoots, leaves, and eats\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there you have it. Have fun generating your own version of Oxford Comma triples to engage in civil discussions with your fellow grammar focused friends 😄."

    "section": "Task 2: Generating Sequentially Numbered BibTeX Entries",
    "text": "Task 2: Generating Sequentially Numbered BibTeX Entries\n\nThe central problem\nIn this case I needed to generate several BibTeX entries of the form:\n@misc{doe2019_lec1,\nauthor        = {Doe, John},\ntitle         = {Lecture Note 1 - STAT10A},\nmonth         = {March},\nyear          = {2018},\nurl           = {https://statschool/~doe/stats10A/Lectures/Lecture01.pdf},\n}\nAs it can be seen the lectures are numbered sequentially and change in the main BibTeX id, the title, and the url field.\nSpecifically I needed to construct 30 such sequential entries for lectures 1-30. Rather than do this manually, I realized that this would be fun scripting exercise with using the tidyverse packages glue, purrr, and stringr.\nGoal: Create 30 such BibTeX entries and print to the console to directly-copy paste to my BibTeX file.\n\n\nThe tidy approach\nFirst step is to write a function that takes a lecture number (integer) as an input and then outputs a single BibTeX entry for that lecture.\n\n# Generate BibTeX entry for a single lecture number\nget_lec_bibtex <- function(lec_num){\n  # Get the 2 character padded lecture number i.e. 1 -> \"01\"\n  lec_num_pad <- str_pad(string = lec_num, width = 2,\n                         side = \"left\", pad = \"0\")\n\n  # Construct the BibTeX entry\n  out_bbtex_str <- glue(\n    \"@misc{doe2019_lec<lec_num>,\n    author = {Doe, John},\n    title  = {Lecture Note <lec_num> - STAT10A},\n    month  = {March},\n    year   = {2018},\n    url    = {https://www.hpg/~doe/st10A/lecs/lec<lec_num_pad>.pdf}}\",\n    .open = \"<\",\n    .close = \">\")\n\n  return(out_bbtex_str)\n}\n\nNote that by default glue allows you to substitute input text in between { and } markers. However BibTeX entries already have literal default {} tags that we need to include in our function output. Rather than escaping them the glue package conveniently allows us to change the default opening and closing markers 💯! We simply set these to be angle brackets < > using the .open and .close options above.\n\nNote: Luckily we don’t have literal angle brackets in our BibTeX output to deal with here\n\nLet’s just test this out quickly:\n\nlec_no <- 1\nget_lec_bibtex(lec_num = lec_no)\n\n@misc{doe2019_lec1,\nauthor = {Doe, John},\ntitle  = {Lecture Note 1 - STAT10A},\nmonth  = {March},\nyear   = {2018},\nurl    = {https://www.hpg/~doe/st10A/lecs/lec01.pdf}}\n\n\nGreat - looks like it is working as required with the correct string padding in the lecture number in the pdf filename!\n\nNote: We used the stringr str_pad to convert 1 to \"01\"\n\n\n\nApply to all lectures using purrr\nLet’s finish this by creating all the entries using purrr:\n\nlec_nums <- c(1, 30)\nlec_nums %>%\n  map_chr(.x = ., .f = ~get_lec_bibtex(lec_num = .x)) %>%\n  cat(., sep = \"\\n\\n\")\n\n@misc{doe2019_lec1,\nauthor = {Doe, John},\ntitle  = {Lecture Note 1 - STAT10A},\nmonth  = {March},\nyear   = {2018},\nurl    = {https://www.hpg/~doe/st10A/lecs/lec01.pdf}}\n\n@misc{doe2019_lec30,\nauthor = {Doe, John},\ntitle  = {Lecture Note 30 - STAT10A},\nmonth  = {March},\nyear   = {2018},\nurl    = {https://www.hpg/~doe/st10A/lecs/lec30.pdf}}\n\n\nYay - this works as expected! We can now paste into BibTeX as required.\nNote that we only created it for lectures 1 and 30 for easy scrolling. But for all lectures we can just replace c(1, 30) with 1:30 in the above code."

First we will load the required libraries needed for the analysis.\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nIn the article the authors cite several resources for collecting the data for this task. Per the article we note that the data is already pre-baked into R and located in datasets::Titanic when R loads, which is convenient 😎.\nWe can source the data and start cleaning it for our exploration, using the handy clean_names function for column name cleaning and converting various categorical variables (age, sex, survivorship, and passenger class) to factors for easy plotting later.\n\n# Basic cleaning of names and filtering out non-zero counts\nt1 <- datasets::Titanic %>%\n        as_tibble() %>%\n        clean_names(dat = .) %>%\n        filter(.data = ., n != 0) %>%\n        mutate(.data = .,\n                      new_sex = ifelse(age == \"Child\", age, sex),\n                      n_sgnd = ifelse(survived == \"No\", -1*n, n)) %>%\n        select(class, new_sex, survived, n_sgnd)\n\n# Passenger (non-crew) level aggregation\nt2 <- t1 %>%\n        filter(class != \"Crew\") %>%\n        mutate(class = \"Pass.\") %>%\n        group_by(class, new_sex, survived) %>%\n        summarize(n_sgnd = sum(n_sgnd))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'class', 'new_sex'.

As you can see, the data cleaning was done in stages where 3 datasets t1, t2, t3 were built up. Essentially by staring at the plot it is clear that plots are split by class i.e. \\(1^{st}\\) Class, \\(2^{nd}\\) Class etc. This is the cleaned t1 data frame. However there are aggregate versions of these classes at combined Passenger level and Passenger and Crew level which are the t2 and t3 tibbles respectively. Finally we concatenate them together into ttnc_cln and ensure our categorical variables are cast as factors.\nNext step - plotting!"

This book is simply amazing in that Prof. Steele walks through deriving mathematical inequalities as if you were having a casual chat together using a whiteboard. I’ve been working through through the problems in detail and they are a great challenge! I’ll blog more about this as I finish the book in the August 2019 roundup.\n\nNote: the text contains full solutions making it ideal for self-study (but I refuse to peek for now)\nFiction\n\nRead Celeste Ng’s Everything I Never Told You. Very nicely written debut novel by Ng, though quite dark and brooding in tone. Would not recommend as a pick me up but certainly would for a nice American-Asian character study set in the 1970s."

I simply created a Disqus account and selected Get Started. I then clicked the following button to Install Disqus on my site.\n\n\n\nGetting Started with Disqus\n\n\nI was then presented with the following Disqus site configuration menu. I entered https:://www.shamindras.com/ for my Website Name and manually set my Disqus shortname to be shamindras-distill to be easier to remember and specific to this site, in case I make more websites later on. This Disqus shortname is important to note down (🖊) as we’ll see shortly.\n\n\n\nSetup Disqus shortname\n\n\nAfter clicking Create Site in the previous menu I proceeded to select the free plan option by subscribing to the Basic, Free, Ads Supported comments option as seen below:\n\nAs a student got to always know when to get a freebie 😄\n\n\n\n\nSelect Basic (Free, Ads supported) mode\n\n\nIn terms of implementing Disqus on my site, I clicked on the following button to install Disqus on my site manually:\n\n\n\nManual installation of Disqus\n\n\nBefore finishing the manual installation of Disqus I ensured that I set the following configuration options. I particularly like setting an opiononated comments policy and selected the Grist Comment Policy:\n\n\n\nDisqus Configuration Settings\n\n\nFinally to ensure that the implementation is completed I added the following line to the _site.yml post using the Disqus shortname set earlier i.e. shamindras-distill and ensuring hidden: true so that the comments are not expanded by default:\n\nNote: You can see my _site.yml with these settings here\n\n\ncollections:\n  posts:\n    disqus:\n      shortname: shamindras-distill\n      hidden: true\n\nWe now see the following comments option at the bottom of every post:\n\n\n\nDistill Disqus Comments Selection\n\n\nYou can read more about setting up comments from the official distill blog here"

Per the article we note that the data is already pre-baked into R and located in datasets::Titanic when R loads, which is convenient 😎.\nWe can source the data and start cleaning it for our exploration, using the handy clean_names function for column name cleaning and converting various categorical variables (age, sex, survivorship, and passenger class) to factors for easy plotting later.\n\n# Basic cleaning of names and filtering out non-zero counts\nt1 <- datasets::Titanic %>%\n        as_tibble() %>%\n        clean_names(dat = .) %>%\n        filter(.data = ., n != 0) %>%\n        mutate(.data = .,\n                      new_sex = ifelse(age == \"Child\", age, sex),\n                      n_sgnd = ifelse(survived == \"No\", -1*n, n)) %>%\n        select(class, new_sex, survived, n_sgnd)\n\n# Passenger (non-crew) level aggregation\nt2 <- t1 %>%\n        filter(class != \"Crew\") %>%\n        mutate(class = \"Pass.\") %>%\n        group_by(class, new_sex, survived) %>%\n        summarize(n_sgnd = sum(n_sgnd))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'class', 'new_sex'.

As you can see, the data cleaning was done in stages where 3 datasets t1, t2, t3 were built up. Essentially by staring at the plot it is clear that plots are split by class i.e. \\(1^{st}\\) Class, \\(2^{nd}\\) Class etc. This is the cleaned t1 data frame. However there are aggregate versions of these classes at combined Passenger level and Passenger and Crew level which are the t2 and t3 tibbles respectively. Finally we concatenate them together into ttnc_cln and ensure our categorical variables are cast as factors.\nNext step - plotting!"

This is a really nice tool to use for reproducing colors viewed through a browser\nI don’t quite like that the non-survivors here are shown on a negative scale, but this was the quick hack I could perform to get bars flipped for non-survivors vs. survivors\n\nSummary: Overall this was a really fun challenge and I learned a lot about old-school data visualization using the glorius modern tidyverse ecosystem we have at our fingertips. Will do a similar reproducibility challenge again for sure ✌️. Have fun playing around with the above and please post in the comments any questions/feedback you may have 👍."

    "text": "In a custom \\(\\LaTeX\\) macro file I needed to generate several sequential \\(\\LaTeX\\) newcommand entries of the form:\n\\newcommand{\\bfa}{\\mathbf{a}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\mathbf{A}}\nWhere using $\\bfa$ produces \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and using $\\bfA$ produces \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) i.e the lowecase/uppercase mathbf commands respectively.\nSpecifically I needed to construct 52 such combined sequential entries for both lowercase/uppercase letter versions of these newcommand \\(\\LaTeX\\) macros. Rather than do this manually, I realized that this would be another fun scripting exercise with using the tidyverse packages glue, purrr, and stringr similar to this similar previous post here.\nGoal: Create 52 such lowercase/uppercase newcommand entries and print to the console to directly-copy paste to my \\(\\LaTeX\\) macros file.\n\n\n\nFirst step is to write a function that takes as an input the following:\n\na single letter (case-sensitive) e.g. \"a\"\nthe macro shortcut command prefix you prefer e.g \"bf\" (for bold font in case you were wondering!)\nthe specific \\(\\LaTeX\\) command that we are creating a macro shortcut for i.e. \"mathbf\" in this case\n\nThe function then outputs a single newcommand entry for that lecture i.e \\newcommand{\\bfa}{\\mathbf{a}} in this case. Let’s do it!\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n# Create LaTeX macro newcommand\nget_lec_newcmd <- function(inp_letr, mac_type, mac_ref){\n    out_str <- glue('\\\\newcommand{\\\\<mac_type><inp_letr>}{\\\\<mac_ref>{<inp_letr>}}',\n                    .open = \"<\", .close = \">\")\n    return(out_str)\n}\n\nLet’s just test this out quickly:\n\nc(\"a\", \"A\") %>%\n  map_chr(.x = ., .f = ~get_lec_newcmd(inp_letr = .x,\n                                       mac_type = \"bf\",\n                                       mac_ref = \"mathbf\")) %>%\n  cat(., sep = \"\\n\")\n\n\\newcommand{\\bfa}{\\mathbf{a}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\mathbf{A}}\n\n\nGreat - looks like it is working as required!\nNote that we can easily generate other \\(\\LaTeX\\) macros like follows\n\nc(\"a\", \"A\") %>%\n  map_chr(.x = ., .f = ~get_lec_newcmd(inp_letr = .x,\n                                       mac_type = \"mc\",\n                                       mac_ref = \"mathcal\")) %>%\n  cat(., sep = \"\\n\")\n\n\\newcommand{\\mca}{\\mathcal{a}}\n\\newcommand{\\mcA}{\\mathcal{A}}\n\n\nWhich generates the corresponding mathcal macros for \\(\\mathcal{a}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) respectively.\nSo finally we can generate all 52 letter macros at time by simply replacing c(\"a\", \"A\") with c(letters, LETTERS) which uses the input lowercase/uppercase letters/LETTERS vectors in base R:\n\n\n\n Full newcommand Demo Output \n\n\n\\newcommand{\\bfa}{\\mathbf{a}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfb}{\\mathbf{b}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfc}{\\mathbf{c}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfd}{\\mathbf{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfe}{\\mathbf{e}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\mathbf{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\mathbf{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfh}{\\mathbf{h}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfi}{\\mathbf{i}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfj}{\\mathbf{j}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfk}{\\mathbf{k}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfl}{\\mathbf{l}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfm}{\\mathbf{m}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfn}{\\mathbf{n}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfo}{\\mathbf{o}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\mathbf{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\mathbf{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfr}{\\mathbf{r}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfs}{\\mathbf{s}}\n\\newcommand{\\bft}{\\mathbf{t}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\mathbf{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\mathbf{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfw}{\\mathbf{w}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\mathbf{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfy}{\\mathbf{y}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfz}{\\mathbf{z}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\mathbf{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\mathbf{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\mathbf{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfD}{\\mathbf{D}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfE}{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfF}{\\mathbf{F}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfG}{\\mathbf{G}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfH}{\\mathbf{H}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfI}{\\mathbf{I}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\mathbf{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfK}{\\mathbf{K}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfL}{\\mathbf{L}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\mathbf{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfN}{\\mathbf{N}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfO}{\\mathbf{O}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfP}{\\mathbf{P}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfQ}{\\mathbf{Q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\mathbf{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfS}{\\mathbf{S}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\mathbf{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfU}{\\mathbf{U}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfV}{\\mathbf{V}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfW}{\\mathbf{W}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfX}{\\mathbf{X}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfY}{\\mathbf{Y}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfZ}{\\mathbf{Z}}\n\n\n\nHope you have fun using this to quickly generate your \\(\\LaTeX\\) newcommand macros ✌️."

    "section": "Interesting Interviews",
    "text": "Interesting Interviews\n\nReally enjoyed this interview with Prof. Noga Alon a leading mathematician specializing in combinatorics, graph theory etc. Fantastic insights into the life of a (leading) theoretical researcher and certainly someone for me to look up to and learn from. I enjoyed the fact that it was so brief but dense as I normally don’t have much time for podcasts. I may check out a few more scientific based interviews from this Career Yoga podcast going forward.\n\nNote: This interview was co-conducted Ms. Narkis Alon, the daughter of Prof. Alon which led to a really personal dynamic!\nKey Takeaways\n\nThis 20min interview is really part of a podcast on careers, and the focus here being the lessons/insights learned from a very successful career in theoretical mathematical research from Prof. Alon\nProf. Alon appears to be extremely organized in all aspects of life, including packing for trips. Was asked specifically not to prepare for this interview 😄\nI’ve paraphrased my summaries below, any transcription errors are mine. Please listen to the original interview.\nQuestion: What does it mean to be a mathematician?\n\n\nTo mostly think about mathematical problems, there are many mathematical problems that have rich history, many are interesting in their own sense. It means to ask the right questions, think about interesting questions and tell the difference between what is beautiful and what is not beautiful\n\n\nQuestion: What does your day look like?\n\n\nMany procedural things - teaching, meeting graduate students, reading mathematical papers.\n\n\nPart of the time I’m just thinking! Sometimes with other people over chalkboard/whiteboard, looking at a piece of paper on the table i.e. trying to do some computations that are relevant, thinking of relationships to the problem. Finding problems that are similar enough.\n\n\nQuestion: It is so difficult to grasp the idea of just thinking! Most of the careers are based on the idea of responding to things. Often when visiting you in Princeton it seems you are in a room staring in the air, in another room people another mathematician is staring in the air, it seems like you are not doing anything!\n\n\nRight, and indeed in much of time you are not doing anything. Most of the time you are failing and you need to get used to to it Part of the satisfaction is this process is to think about something for a very long time without having an idea. Sometimes you solve something related\n\n\nQuestion: Do you sometimes try to initiate situations that will inspire you to solve problems\n\n\nYou go to conferences, talk to people, read papers etc. Many times you just need to be in a different state of mind e.g. if you forget someones name, just thinking about it does not always make you remember, just need to try something else at times. This may explain why you see people staring in the air! Sometimes you can go and take walks.\n\n\nQuestion: When did you know you wanted to be a mathematician?\n\n\nAs a child, before I was 10 years old I knew I was interested in mathematical puzzles. I was good at it and interested in mathematics but didn’t really know what it involved. I always liked that it is objective. I was able to explain a solution to an adult at a party on the puzzle of the Eurovision song contest. The power of convincing someone is really powerful.\n\n\nQuestion: Was the long list of awards you aimed for?\n\n\nNo, it’s nice to get such prizes but never done this with the intent. In every field it is important, but the glory is very limited. This is nice but you don’t do things with this aim in mind\n\n\nQuestion: In one of your discoveries, did you ever feel “this was something I was dreaming on and I accomplished that”\n\n\nI had a few things where I was very happy. Because I had thought about it for a long time and found something new. Don’t think I had a specific time where I sat back and said this is the best discovery of their life. One should always think that the best discoveries are ahead of them.\n\n\nQuestion: What do mathematicians do after leaving research?\n\n\nSome scientists go into scientific management. Some go into industry, but this is rare. As long as what I do is what I find interesting and challenging, and what I do is not as good as my best results I would still keep doing this.\n\n\nQuestion: Does being a grandfather and becoming older change your priorities and motivation?\n\n\nYes, in general you realize you want to spend time with family, children, and grandchildren. I don’t think it comes instead of science. I hope to keep doing good work and spend time with family."

    "text": "Interesting Articles\n\nCame across this amazing guide to reading an R help file. Experienced R users can use this fantastic pedagogical tool by Kieran Healy to teach new R users on how to read internal R help documentation.\n\nCame across this fascinating article on how calorie burning being a chess grandmaster is by Aishwarya Kumar\nKey Takeaways\n\nArticle notes that chess grandmasters can burn as much as 6000 calories individually during an intense day of sedentary chess playing!\nInitial focus is on Fabiano Caruana, an American grandmaster in chess, and current world No. 2. Caruana has to maintain a very strict diet and exercise routine, particularly during tournaments\nPrimary reasons for the calorie loss are heavy mental stress of the tournament, constantly thinking of chess, thus leaving limited time to think about and consume food\nInteresting quote:\n\n\n…India’s first grandmaster, Viswanathan Anand, does two hours of cardio each night to tire himself out so he doesn’t dream about chess\n\n\nMagnus Carlsen, reigning No. 1, for example consulted a professional nutritionist who recommended that he stop drinking orange juice (to avoid sugar spikes) and replace it with a less sugary regular/chocolate milk blend\nCarlsen has also optimized sitting. This is quite amazing and something to think about personally as someone who spends many hours daily in front of a screen\nCarlsen has also undertaken load management (minimizing competitions participated) to increase the amount of recuperation time between tournaments\nIn short, there are a lot of parallels to the research life which I undertake, and a lot of useful tips to optimize energy and time spent doing what I enjoy for longer\n\n\n\nThis is a really insightful interview with Hadley Wickham, a recent COPSS award winner, on the future of the R programming language:\nKey Takeaways\n\nWickham notes that R vs Python language wars are not constructive in moving data science and other fields forward.\nI agree wholeheartedly on this and firmly believe in using the best tools for the statistical job at hand. What should matter are more critical aspects like code readability, usability, and reproducibility in light of the given task\nInterestingly Wickham notes:\n\n\nA pattern that I see is that the data science team in a company uses R and the data engineering team uses Python\n\n\nWickham also has focused on bridging divides within the R community itself, namely in developing the dtplyr package to convert dplyr code to the alternative data.table package syntax. This is a promising direction ahead where tidyverse and data.table users can collaborate much more easily\nThere is also a focus on encouraging diversity in R usage and actively developing communities. He asks:\n\n\nCan we take the R-Ladies model and help other groups that are currently underserved?\n\n\nOverall it is good that Wickham was recognized recently with the famous COPSS medal in statistics and that the community is embracing software development and design as a key aspect of our profession. It seems that the future is bright for statistics!\n\n\nThis is a nice blogpost on making modular Rmarkdown files. In fact this modular Rmd approach is now used in my blog for common footer files. Did not realize how nicely the here package works with references in Rmd chunks."

    "text": "Interesting Presentations\n\n\nThis thoughtful presentation on Design at Quora by Rebecca Cox (VP of design at Quora). I’ve summarized what I feel are the key points from this important presentation below.\nKey Takeaways\n\nCox notes that it is a “great time to be a designer” because design has proven again and again to be a clear competitive advantage in tech\nShe notes her awareness of Quora’s apparent minimalist design interface i.e. dark, red, and text heavy\nCox asks - what is Design? Some say it is the visual style, for some the user interaction, and for others “it begins and ends with the logo”\nFor Cox, her definition is abstract, and summarized as:\n\n\nThe set of decisions about a product\n\n\nNot just an interface, logo etc. Designing is about making product decisions\nBenefits of this broad decision-driven definition for Quora are:\n\nA clear relationship between the product and the interface i.e. why should a dropdown even exist?\nConcentrates attention on where it matters most i.e. company goals\nEnables a role within Quora that balances authority and responsibility i.e. Designers should do more than “apply a coat of paint to a feature at the end”\n\n\nTo Cox:\n\n\nGreat design is all the work you don’t ask people who use your products to do\n\n\nThere are a lot of deep direct applications to my statistics research i.e. ensure all theoretical and empirical tools are seamlessly able to be conveyed to end users in science, industry, or academia.\nI will be coming back to this over time periodically and reflect if I have undertaken this definition of design and applied it in my work and daily life\n\n\n\nThis is a really inspiring presentation on how data science is used at the ACLU specifically in the recent border immigration policies by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu.\nKey Takeaways\n\nUtilizing tidyverse to sort through messy data linkage issues in a consistent framework is well thought out by the team with useful packaged functions created for use by the wider ACLU team\nHere both statistics and law are used to tackle a major humanitarian issue i.e. child border separation. This is deeply inspiring and the kind of applied work that I would like to contribute to meaningfully in the future\nI particularly appreciated the general data source skepticism showed by the ACLU team. As a statistician it is important to not only explore data but be very skeptical of the source quality i.e. competing legal bodies may not provide the ACLU unbiased data!"

    "text": "Interesting Articles\n\n\nCame across this nice article on R error handling. See here for the original source.\nKey Takeaways\n\nThis the latest post from the ACLU Tech & Analytics blog. This post explains the key focus of the ACLU analytics team on having clean data pipelines and using testing and assertions to facilitate this process\nUsing functions like assertthat::noNA(df$source) will return a FALSE if in fact there are no NA values in the df$source column. This seems like a very useful function to use in %>% operations in my pipelines!\nUsed in combination with assertthat::noNA(df$source) will return the actual observations that have NA values, which is super useful!\n\nThese operations are %>% friendly and can be used to verify join operations perform as expected, for example:\n\nDoes the join have the same number of rows as the original left-hand table or did the data structure of the right-hand table create new rows?\n\n\nHow much of the right-hand table of the join falls away in the left join?\n\n\n\nThese checks are notably useful for the ACLU to also check for missingness in their data pipelines. They note:\n\nA helpful check to assess whether missingness grossly misrepresents our results is to quantify the severity of the problem. What level of missingness are we willing to live with?\n\n\nThis definitely seems useful to me, as I use ad-hoc approaches to these same issues e.g. na.omit without doing thorough assertions. Perhaps using this with tidylog will be useful in doing EDA. Let’s try and revisit this.\n\n\n\nThis is a really insightful article on A regular person’s guide to outbreak preparedness, by Prof. Eleanor Murray:\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the event of well publicized (ready mass hysteria) virus spreads such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak, it is important to listen to level-headed healthcare professionals. In this case it is Prof. Elie Murray, an epidimiologist from Boston University\nSince I’m definitely a newbie to understanding this epidemic, I found this to be a very pragmatic guide to help prepare and prevent any further spread of such diseases\n\nIn terms of general healthy practices in the outbreak the key takeaways are to:\n\nWash your hands regularly\nFocus on improving the immune system\nTry to not catch other infections, and ensure you recover well from any existing infections\nDon’t panic\n\n\n\nIn terms of good practices to do in the event that you are sick, the key takeaways are to:\n\nStay home and recover\nCover your mouth e.g. sneeze into the inner elbow\nCall a medical professional if you or a relative was in Wuhan recently\nSeek urgent medical care if you feel really sick\n\n\nPlease read the article on more detail on each of the above points and also to considerations for high risk individuals, a sick family member/friend, and if you are a healthcare responder\nOverall, great practical advice! It is great to see statisticians such as Prof. Murray take the lead and address the community at large with their knowledge and expertise, when we live in an era of misinformation\nI enjoyed the emphasisis on solving this challenge (like many others) as a community"

    "text": "TL;DR\nI walk through a cool and possibly less known result connecting convexity and the triangle inequalities for norms. Using this result, typical proofs of the triangle inequality for a proposed norm function are significantly simplified. This exposition is based on (Chapter 3, Robinson 2020) 1.\n(Robinson 2020) is a wonderful functional analysis book, highly recommend it 💯!\nBackground - Norms\n Experienced readers can freely skip this Background section.\nNormed linear spaces are a natural setting for much applied mathematics and statistics. These are vector spaces, \\(V\\), endowed with a norm function, \\(\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{V}\\). Intuitively, norms give us a “yardstick” to measure the “lengths” of individual vectors in the given vector space space. A standard definition of a norm is as follows:\n\nDefinition 1 (Norms in vector spaces) For a given vector space \\(V\\), a norm \\(\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{V}: V \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), is a function satisfying the following three properties.\n\n\nPositive definiteness: For a \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V\\), if \\(\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert = 0\\) then \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}\\).\n\nAbsolute homogeneity: \\(\\lVert \\lambda \\mathbf{x} \\rVert = | \\lambda | \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert\\), for a \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nTriangle inequality: \\(\\lVert \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y} \\rVert \\leq \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert + \\lVert \\mathbf{y} \\rVert\\), for a \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\\).\n\n\nWe often use many norms on a given vector space, depending on which seems “meaningful” for the given purpose. See here for common examples.\nRemarks\n\nRemark (Derived properties from Definition 1). We note that a norm, per Definition 1, in fact, implies the following properties:\n\nIn Definition 1, we can always replace positive definiteness with the stronger claim, namely that \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\text{For a $\\mathbf{x} \\in V$, if $\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert = 0 \\iff \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}$.}\n\\end{equation}\\] In short, we want to show that the reverse implication to positive definiteness always holds, i.e., \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}_{V} \\implies \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert = 0\\). To prove this observe that using absolute homogeneity in Definition 1, we have: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert\n= \\lVert \\mathbf{0}_{V} \\rVert\n= \\lVert 0 (\\mathbf{0}_{V}) \\rVert\n= |0| \\lVert \\mathbf{0}_{V} \\rVert = 0\n\\end{equation}\\] As required.\nWe also have that \\(\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert \\geq 0\\), for a \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V\\). To see this, observe that for a \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V\\) \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n0\n& = \\lVert \\mathbf{0}_{V} \\rVert\n\\quad\\text{(by previous part of this remark)}\\\\\n& = \\lVert \\mathbf{x} + (-\\mathbf{x}) \\rVert \\\\\n&\\leq \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert + \\lVert -\\mathbf{x} \\rVert\n\\quad\\text{(by the triangle inequality)} \\\\\n&= \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert +\n    \\lvert -1 \\rvert \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert\n    \\quad\\text{(by absolute homogeneity)} \\\\\n&= 2 \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert \\\\\n\\implies \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert\n& \\geq 0\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\] In effect this means the co-domain can always be changed from \\(\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{V}: V \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{V}: V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\).\nSince these can always be derived directly from Definition 1, as shown, we can keep Definition 1 in its minimal form as noted here.\nThese ideas work for seminorms as well, see here for more details.\n\n\nMain theorem\n This is based on (Lemmas 3.3-3.4 Robinson 2020).\n\nTheorem 1 (Characterization of norm triangle inequality) Let \\(N: V \\to \\mathbb{R_{\\geq 0}}\\), be a function satisfying the following two properties2.\n\n\nPositive definiteness: For a \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V\\), if \\(N(\\mathbf{x}) = 0\\) then \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}\\).\n\nAbsolute homogeneity: \\(N(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}) = | \\lambda | N(\\mathbf{x})\\), for a \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nWe then have that:\n\\[\n    N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\n    \\text{, for each } \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\n    \\iff \\mathbb{B} := \\{\\mathbf{z} \\in V \\:|\\: N(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1 \\}\n    \\text{ is convex}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\nIn simple terms, the importance of Theorem 1 (as captured by Equation 1) can be summarized as follows:\n\nLet \\(N : V \\to [0, \\infty)\\) be a function satisfying positive definiteness and absolute homogeneity. Then \\(N\\) satisfies the triangle inequality if and only if the unit ba induced by \\(N\\), i.e., \\(\\mathbb{B} := \\{\\mathbf{z} \\in V \\:|\\: N(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1 \\}\\), is a convex set.\n\nRemarks\n\nRemark. In Theorem 1, we note the following:\n\nThe function \\(N : V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\), is a norm-like function, and only becomes a valid norm per Definition 1 once we establish the triangle inequality, i.e., \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\).\nTo prove the triangle inequality for \\(N : V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\), the necessary condition of Theorem 1 to establish is: \\[\n\\mathbb{B} := \\{\\mathbf{z} \\in V \\:|\\: N(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1 \\}\n\\text{ is convex}\n\\tag{2}\\] which will imply the triangle inequality for \\(N\\) - huzzah!\nThe nice thing is, proving the convexity of \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) can be much easier to show than trying to prove the triangle inequality property of \\(N\\) directly, as we will soon see.\n\nSubtle point: note that here we had to assume that the co-domain of \\(N\\) is non-negative (not \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)), i.e., \\(N : V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\). This is because in a typical norm, which satisfies the triangle inequality, is always shown to be non-negative (see remark below Definition 1 for more details). Here we impose non-negativity of \\(N\\) as an additional constraint to establish the triangle inequality property for \\(N\\). This is not an issue, since one would always first check the non-negativity of a candidate norm-like function \\(N\\).\n\n\nApplications: Minkowski inequalities\nBefore getting into the details of the proof, let’s just see what Theorem Theorem 1 can do! We’ll consider two related applications taken from (Lemma 3.6, Example 3.13 Robinson 2020), respectively.\nApplication 1: \\(\\ell_{p}\\)-norm triangle inequality in \\(\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\)\n\n\nExample 1 (Minkowski inequality in finite dimensions) Let us consider \\((\\mathbb{F}^{n}, \\mathbb{F})\\), where \\(\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{R} \\text{ or } \\mathbb{C}\\). We then define the norm-like function \\(N_{\\ell^{p}}: \\mathbb{F}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\):\n\\[\n    N_{\\ell^{p}}(\\mathbf{x})\n    :=\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left|x_{j}\\right|^{p}\\right)^{1 / p}\n    , \\quad 1 \\leq p<\\infty\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nOne can show that \\(N_{\\ell^{p}}\\) satisfies positive definiteness and absolute homogeneity. To show that \\(N_{\\ell^{p}}\\) is a norm function we need to prove the triangle inequality. We will use Theorem 1. Let us define \\(\\mathbb{B} := \\{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{n} \\:|\\: N_{\\ell^{p}}(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1 \\} = \\{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{n} \\:|\\: N_{\\ell^{p}}^{p}(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1 \\}\\). We now need to show that \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) is convex. We will need to use the fact that for each \\(t \\in \\mathbb{R}, t \\mapsto |t|^{p}\\) is convex. Let \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\), we then have that for \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\):\nNote: \\(t \\mapsto |t|^{p}\\), is convex, for each \\(t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(p \\in [1, \\infty)\\). Sketch: We have, \\(|t|^{p} =: h(t) := (g \\circ f) (t)\\). Here, for each \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), we observe \\(g : x \\mapsto x^{p}\\) is increasing and convex, and \\(f : x \\mapsto |x|\\) is convex. Thus, \\(h(t) := |t|^{p}\\) is convex. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    N_{\\ell^{p}}^{p}(\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y})\n    & = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}|\\lambda| x_{j}|+(1-\\lambda)| y_{j}||^{p}\n    \\quad\\text{(by definition)} \\\\\n    & \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\lambda\\left|x_{j}\\right|^{p}+(1-\\lambda)\\left|y_{j}\\right|^{p}\n    \\quad\\text{(since $t \\mapsto |t|^{p}$ is convex for each $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$)} \\\\\n    & = \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left|x_{j}\\right|^{p}\n    + (1 - \\lambda) \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left|y_{j}\\right|^{p} \\\\\n    & \\leq 1\n    \\quad\\text{(since $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}$.)}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIt follows that \\(N_{\\ell^{p}}(\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y}) \\leq 1\\), and so \\(\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\), as required \\(\\blacksquare\\).\nThis triangle inequality is proved in just four lines 🔥!\nIn fact, since it \\(N_{\\ell^{p}}\\) satisfies the three conditions for a norm per Definition 1 we can now denote it using the conventional \\(\\ell_{p}\\)-norm form, i.e., \\(\\| \\mathbf{x} \\|_{\\ell^{p}} := N_{\\ell^{p}}(\\mathbf{x})\\)\nApplication 2: \\(L_{p}\\)-norm triangle inequality\nWe can also similarly prove the triangle inequality norms involving integrals efficiently. This is seen in the next example.\nHere \\(C([0, 1])\\) is the space of continuous functions on the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nLet us consider \\((C([0, 1]), \\mathbb{R})\\). We then define the norm-like function \\(N_{L^{p}}: C([0, 1]) \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\):\n\\[\n    N_{L^{p}}(\\mathbf{x})\n    :=\\left(\\int_{0}^{1}\\left|f(x)\\right|^{p}\\right)^{1 / p}\n    , \\quad 1 \\leq p<\\infty\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nLet us define \\(\\mathbb{B} := \\{h \\in C([0, 1]) \\:|\\: N_{L^{p}}(h) \\leq 1 \\} = \\{h \\in C([0, 1]) \\:|\\: N_{L^{p}}^{p}(h) \\leq 1 \\}\\). We now need to show that \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) is convex. Let \\(f, g \\in \\mathbb{B}\\), we then have that for \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\):\nOnce again, one can show that \\(N_{\\ell^{p}}\\) satisfies positive definiteness and absolute homogeneity.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    N_{L^{p}}^{p}(\\lambda f + (1 - \\lambda) g)\n    & = \\int_{0}^{1}|\\lambda f(x) + (1-\\lambda) g(x)|^{p} dx\n    \\quad\\text{(by definition)} \\\\\n    & \\leq \\int_{0}^{1}\\lambda |f(x)|^{p} + (1-\\lambda) |g(x)|^{p} dx\n    \\quad\\text{(since $t \\mapsto |t|^{p}$ is convex for each $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$)} \\\\\n    & = \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)|^{p} dx + (1-\\lambda) \\int_{0}^{1} |g(x)|^{p} dx \\\\\n    & \\leq 1\n    \\quad\\text{(since $f, g \\in \\mathbb{B}$.)}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIt follows that \\(N_{L^{p}}(\\lambda f + (1 - \\lambda) g) \\leq 1\\), and so \\(\\lambda f + (1 - \\lambda) g \\in \\mathbb{B}\\), as required \\(\\blacksquare\\).\nAgain, we can now denote \\(N_{L^{p}}\\) using the conventional \\(L_{p}\\)-norm form, i.e., \\(\\| f \\|_{L^{p}} := N_{L^{p}}(f)\\).\nPunchline: what did Theorem 1 buy us?\nWe just saw that applying Theorem 1 enabled us to write very short proofs of Minkowski’s inequality in \\(\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\) and \\(C([0, 1])\\).\nTo appreciate this approach, note that proving Minkowski’s inequality typicay requires one to first prove Young’s inequality and then Hölder’s inequality. Moreover these need to be done separately in \\(\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\) and \\(C([0, 1])\\). Using Theorem 1 aowed us to achieve both of these goals using near identical style of proofs 🎉!\nNote: The proofs of Young’s and Hölder’s inequality are beautiful and studying them is also insightful.\nProof of Theorem 1\nAssuming \\(N: V \\to \\mathbb{R_{\\geq 0}}\\) satisfies the two properties in Theorem Theorem 1, we need to prove both implications in Equation Equation 1.\nProof - easy direction\nAssume that \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\), for each \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\\). Let \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\) be arbitrary. We need to show that this implies for each \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\) that the expression \\(\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\) holds. This implies the convexity of \\(\\mathbb{B}\\).\nProof\n\nProof. (\\(\\implies\\)) We proceed directly.\nAssume that \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\), for each \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\\). Let \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\) be arbitrary. We need to show that this implies for each \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\) that the expression \\(\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\) holds. This implies the convexity of \\(\\mathbb{B}\\).\nWe observe that for \\(\\lambda \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\) our required expression is equal to either \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) which are both in \\(\\mathbb{B}\\), by assumption. Now fix \\(\\lambda \\in (0, 1)\\). We then note:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    N(\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y})\n    & \\leq N(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}) + N((1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y})\n    \\quad\\text{($N$ satisfies triangle inequality)} \\\\\n    & = \\lvert \\lambda \\rvert N(\\mathbf{x}) + \\lvert 1 - \\lambda \\rvert N(\\mathbf{y})\n    \\quad\\text{(by absolute homogeneity of $N$)} \\\\\n    & = \\lambda N(\\mathbf{x}) + 1 - \\lambda N(\\mathbf{y})\n    \\quad\\text{(since $\\lambda > 0$)} \\\\\n    & \\leq (\\lambda) (1) + (1 - \\lambda) (1)\n    \\quad\\text{(since $N(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1$, for $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{B}$)} \\\\\n    & = 1 \\\\\n\\implies \\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1 - \\lambda) \\mathbf{y}\n    & \\in \\mathbb{B}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhich implies the convexity of \\(\\mathbb{B}\\), as required. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nProof - interesting direction\nAssume \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) is a convex set. We need to show that this implies that \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\), for each \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\\).\nTip: In linear algebra proofs, it is best to first deal with the zero vector, \\(\\mathbf{0}_{V}\\), separately.\nProof\n\nProof. (\\(\\impliedby\\)) We proceed directly.\nAssume \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) is a convex set. We need to show that this implies that \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\), for each \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\\).\nLet \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V\\). We will consider four cases.\nCase 1: Let \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}\\). Then \\(N(\\mathbf{x}) = N(\\mathbf{y}) = N(\\mathbf{0}_{V}) = N(0 \\mathbf{0}_{V}) = |0| N(\\mathbf{0}_{V})= 0\\), by absolute homogeneity of \\(N\\). Indeed we then have that \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) = N(\\mathbf{0}_{V}) = 0 = N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\), as required.\nCase 2: Let \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}_{V}\\}\\). Then \\(N(\\mathbf{y}) = 0\\), and it follows that \\(N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) = N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{0}_{V}) = N(\\mathbf{x}) = N(\\mathbf{x}) + 0 = N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\\), as required.\nCase 3: Let \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in V \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}_{V}\\}, \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}\\). Same as Case 2, with the roles of \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\) reversed.\nCase 4: Let \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}_{V}\\}\\). It then follows that \\(N(\\mathbf{x}), N(\\mathbf{y}) > 0\\), since \\(N(\\mathbf{z}) \\geq 0\\), for each \\(\\mathbf{z} \\in V\\), and \\(N(\\mathbf{z}) = 0 \\iff \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{0}_{V}\\). Moreover we then have that \\(\\lvert N(\\mathbf{x}) \\rvert = N(\\mathbf{x}) > 0\\) and \\(\\lvert N(\\mathbf{y}) \\rvert = N(\\mathbf{y}) > 0\\). So we can safely divide by these quantities. Let us then define \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} := \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{N(\\mathbf{x})}, \\tilde{\\mathbf{y}} := \\frac{\\mathbf{y}}{N(\\mathbf{y})}\\). We then have by absolute homogeneity of \\(N\\) that, \\(N(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) := N\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{N(\\mathbf{x})}\\right) = \\left \\lvert \\frac{1}{N(\\mathbf{x})} \\right \\rvert N(\\mathbf{x}) = 1 \\implies \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\). Similarly \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}} \\in \\mathbb{B}\\). Let us denote \\(\\lambda := \\frac{N(\\mathbf{x})}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})} \\in (0, 1)\\), and \\(\\mathbf{z} := \\frac{\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\). We then have: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    \\mathbf{z}\n    & := \\frac{\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})} \\\\\n    & = \\left(\\frac{N(\\mathbf{x})}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right)\n        \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{N(\\mathbf{x})}\\right) +\n        \\left(\\frac{N(\\mathbf{y})}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right)\n        \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{y}}{N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\left(\\frac{N(\\mathbf{x})}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right)\n        \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} +\n        \\left(\\frac{N(\\mathbf{y})}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right)\n        \\tilde{\\mathbf{y}} \\\\\n    & = \\lambda \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} +\n        (1 - \\lambda) \\tilde{\\mathbf{y}} \\\\\n    & \\in \\mathbb{B}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nBy the assumed convexity of \\(\\mathbb{B}\\). We then have that \\(\\mathbf{z} := \\frac{\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})} \\in \\mathbb{B} \\implies N(\\mathbf{z}) \\leq 1\\). We then observe: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    N(\\mathbf{z})\n    & \\leq 1\n    \\quad\\text{(since $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{B}$.)} \\\\\n\\iff N\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right)\n    & \\leq 1\n    \\quad\\text{(by definition of $\\mathbf{z}$.)} \\\\\n\\iff \\left\\lvert \\frac{1}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\\right\\rvert\n     N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y})\n    & \\leq 1\n    \\quad\\text{(absolute homogeneity of $N$.)} \\\\\n\\iff \\frac{1}{N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})}\n     N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y})\n    & \\leq 1\n    \\quad\\text{(since $N(\\mathbf{x}), N(\\mathbf{y}) > 0$.)} \\\\\n\\iff N(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y})\n    & \\leq N(\\mathbf{x}) + N(\\mathbf{y})\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAs required. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nRecap\nIn this article we learned the following about Theorem 1:\n\nIt gives an alternative way to characterize the triangle inequality for norm-like functions.\nUsing this characterization we can prove the triangle inequality for such norm-like functions using the convexity of the unit ba induced by such functions.\nThis is usuay easier since we have lots of tools from convex analysis to help us prove the convexity of \\(\\mathbb{B}\\).\nWe saw this in action since Theorem 1 enabled us to write very short proofs of Minkowski’s inequality in \\(\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\) and \\(C([0, 1])\\).\n\nIn summary, if you have a norm-like function for which you are trying to establish the triangle inequality, try out Theorem 1 💯!\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Prof. James Robinson for providing several technical clarifications on Theorem 1.

    "text": "Task 1: Generating Oxford Comma Triples\n\nThe central problem\nBased on a fun conversation with my statistics cohort over dinner we got to discussing the famous Oxford Comma (or Serial Comma depending on your persuasion). I’ve never really adopted the use but my friends made a compelling argument on it’s apparent general lack of ambiguity when applied appropriately.\nWe will use the Oxford comma on the famously ambiguous phrase (here used without the Oxford Comma before leaves):\n\nEats, shoots and leaves\n\nAfter adding in the Oxford Comma this would become:\n\nEats, shoots, and leaves\n\nGoal: A fun experiment would be to generate all permutations of this phrase with and without the Oxford Comma using R and specifically the tidyverse packages.\n\n\nGenerating all word-triple permutations the tidy way\nFirst, let’s load our required packages.\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\n\nLet’s also define our unique global word values used to construct the required phrases:\n\nWORD_VALS <- c(\"eats\", \"shoots\", \"leaves\")\n\nGenerate all unique 3-word permutations without replacement from the three unique words. We’ll create a helper function to check that a vector of words is unique.\n\nis_unq_perm <- function(word1, word2, word3){\n    words_vec <- c(word1, word2, word3)\n    return(length(words_vec) - length(unique(words_vec)) == 0)\n}\n\nWe can now simply generate every possible triple with replacement using the tidyr::crossing function. We proceed to filter these \\(3^3 = 27\\) triples for unique triples using our is_unq_perm helper function applied row-by-row using purrr::pmap_lgl. The _lgl simply returns a TRUE/FALSE logical value as intended by the applied function.\n\nNote: The tidyr::crossing generates a Cartesian product of all the 3 word triples, very handy\n\n\n# Generate the unique word-triples\nall_perms <- tidyr::crossing(word1 = WORD_VALS,\n                             word2 = WORD_VALS,\n                             word3 = WORD_VALS) %>%\n                mutate(.data = .,\n                       is_unq_perm = purrr::pmap_lgl(.l = .,\n                                                     is_unq_perm)) %>%\n                filter(.data = ., is_unq_perm) %>%\n                select(-is_unq_perm)\n\n# Display output in a nice centered table\nall_perms %>%\n  kable(x = ., align = 'c',\n        col.names = c(\"Word 1\",\n                      \"Word 2\",\n                      \"Word 3\"))\n\n\n\n\nWord 1\nWord 2\nWord 3\n\n\n\n\neats\nleaves\nshoots\n\n\neats\nshoots\nleaves\n\n\nleaves\neats\nshoots\n\n\nleaves\nshoots\neats\n\n\nshoots\neats\nleaves\n\n\nshoots\nleaves\neats\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat - that part is done! Now we just need to generate for each triple of words an oxford comma and non-oxford comma version. This is done easily using the amazing glue package as seen below:\n\nexprs <- all_perms %>%\n          mutate(non_oxford_comma =\n                   glue_data(.x = .,\n                             \"{word1}, {word2} and {word3}\"),\n                 oxford_comma =\n                   glue_data(.x = .,\n                             \"{word1}, {word2}, and {word3}\")) %>%\n          select(non_oxford_comma, oxford_comma)\n\nWe can display the side-by-side output of the Non-Oxford Comma vs. Oxford comma for the \\(6\\) generated triples as follows:\n\n# Display output in a nice centered table\nexprs %>%\n  kable(x = .,\n        align = 'c',\n        col.names = c(\"Non-Oxford Comma\",\n                      \"Oxford Comma\"))\n\n\n\n\nNon-Oxford Comma\nOxford Comma\n\n\n\n\neats, leaves and shoots\neats, leaves, and shoots\n\n\neats, shoots and leaves\neats, shoots, and leaves\n\n\nleaves, eats and shoots\nleaves, eats, and shoots\n\n\nleaves, shoots and eats\nleaves, shoots, and eats\n\n\nshoots, eats and leaves\nshoots, eats, and leaves\n\n\nshoots, leaves and eats\nshoots, leaves, and eats\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there you have it. Have fun generating your own version of Oxford Comma triples to engage in civil discussions with your fellow grammar focused friends 😄."

I’m also actively interested in statistical ranking (in particular the Bradley-Terry-Luce model), and spatiotemporal modeling (wildfire prediction).\nI particularly enjoy the collaborative aspect of research, and I’m privileged to work with the following brilliant people1: Heejong Bong, Niccolò (Nic) Dalmasso, Riccardo Fogliato, Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla, Wanshan Li, Matey Neykov, Alessandro (Ale) Rinaldo.\nI recommend just perusing some of my papers below to get a better idea of the type of problems I like to work on, and the style of papers I enjoy writing with my co-authors.

Building on the pioneering work of Le Cam (1973), Birge (1983, 1986), Wong and Shen (1995), Yang and Barron (1999), we determine the exact (up to constants) minimax rate over any convex density class. This work thus extends these known results by demonstrating that the local metric entropy of the density class always captures the minimax optimal rates under such settings. Our bounds provide a unifying perspective across both parametric and nonparametric convex density classes, under weaker assumptions on the richness of the density class than previously considered. Our proposed ‘multistage sieve’ MLE applies to any such convex density class. We apply our risk bounds to rederive known minimax rates including bounded total variation, and Holder density classes. We further illustrate the utility of the result by deriving upper bounds for less studied classes, e.g., convex mixture of densities."
