I should note that the\nRStudio `distill` team has already created an [excellent distill blog creation\ntutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html){target=\"_blank\"} which I\nthoroughly used and highly recommend to new users to check out.\n\n<aside>\n\nAdmittedly this blogpost is verbose, but hopefully the details help **new\nusers** of the `distill` blogging package.\n\n</aside>\n\nWith that said, here are some key upgrades I made to this blog.\n\n## Step 1: Setup Disqus comments\n\nI really wanted to setup some comments system for each blogpost. This way I can\nlearn new tips from readers and find out how to improve posts going forward. I\nwill go with the recommended [Disqus comments\noption](https://disqus.com){target=\"_blank\"} from the [distill\nblog](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html#comments-and-sharing){target=\"_blank\"}.\nI simply created a [Disqus](https://disqus.com){target=\"_blank\"} account and\nselected **Get Started**. I then clicked the following button to *Install Disqus\non my site*.\n\n![Getting Started with\nDisqus](images/step_01_disqus_02.png){#step-01-02-screenshot\nalt=\"Getting Started with Disqus\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of getting started with Disqus\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nI was then presented with the following Disqus site configuration menu. I\nentered `https:://www.shamindras.com/` for my **Website Name** and manually set\nmy **Disqus shortname** to be `shamindras-distill` to be easier to remember and\nspecific to this site, in case I make more websites later on. This Disqus\nshortname is important to note down (🖊) as we'll see shortly.\n\n![Setup Disqus shortname](images/step_01_disqus_03.png){#step-01-03-screenshot\nalt=\"Setup Disqus shortname\" fig-alt=\"Screenshot of setting up Disqus shortname\"\nfig-align=\"center\"}\n\nAfter clicking **Create Site** in the previous menu I proceeded to select the\n*free* plan option by subscribing to the *Basic, Free, Ads Supported* comments\noption as seen below:\n\n<aside>\n\nAs a student got to always know when to get a freebie 😄\n\n</aside>\n\n![Select Basic (Free, Ads supported)\nmode](images/step_01_disqus_04.png){#step-01-04-screenshot\nalt=\"Select Basic (Free, Ads supported) mode\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of select basic (Free, Ads supported) mode\"\nfig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn terms of implementing `Disqus` on my site, I clicked on the following button\nto install Disqus on my site manually:\n\n![Manual installation of\nDisqus](images/step_01_disqus_05.png){#step-01-05-screenshot\nalt=\"Manual installation of Disqus\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of manual installation of Disqus\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nBefore finishing the manual installation of `Disqus` I ensured that I set the\nfollowing configuration options. I particularly like setting an opiononated\ncomments policy and selected the [Grist Comment\nPolicy](https://grist.org/grist-comment-policy/){target=\"_blank\"}:\n\n![Disqus Configuration\nSettings](images/step_01_disqus_06.png){#step-01-06-screenshot\nalt=\"Disqus Configuration Settings\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of Disqus configuration settings\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nFinally to ensure that the implementation is completed I added the following\nline to the `_site.yml` post using the **Disqus shortname** set earlier i.e.\n`shamindras-distill` and ensuring `hidden: true` so that the comments are not\nexpanded by default:\n\n<aside>\n\n**Note:** You can see my `_site.yml` with these settings\n[here](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/_site.yml)\n\n</aside>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncollections:\n  posts:\n    disqus:\n      shortname: shamindras-distill\n      hidden: true\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now see the following comments option at the bottom of every post:\n\n![Distill Disqus Comments\nSelection](images/step_01_disqus_07.png){#step-01-07-screenshot\nalt=\"Distill Disqus Comments Selection\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of Distill Disqus comments selection\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nYou can read more about setting up comments from the official `distill` blog\n[here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html#comments-and-sharing)\n\n## Step 2: Setup Google Analytics tracking\n\nI also wanted to setup basic user viewing tracking for my site. Fortunately\n`distill` can be easily configured to work with [Google\nAnalytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web){target=\"_blank\"}. In\norder to set this up I simply created an account for `Google Analytics` (using\nmy personal gmail account). I then logged in and selected the option to track my\nwebsite as follows:\n\n![Google Analytics Settings](images/step_02_ga_01.png){#step-02-01-screenshot\nalt=\"Google Analytics Settings\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of Google Analytics settings\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nNote that I specified the **Website Name** field to be `shamindras-distill`.\nThis is indeed the same as the Disqus shortname from earlier but did not have to\nbe. I just did it for consistency and easy reference. I was then given a\n**Google Analytics token** and concluded this setup by adding the token to the\n`_site.yml` file as follows:\n\n<aside>\n\n**Note:** You can see my `_site.yml` with these settings\n[here](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/_site.yml)\n\n</aside>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngoogle_analytics: \"UA-145015693-1\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can read more about setting up Google Analytics from the official `distill`\nblog [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#google-analytics)\n\n## Step 3: Add Netlify Status Badge\n\nSince [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com){target=\"_blank\"} is the web hosting\nplatform for my site (see setup details\n[here](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-11-setting-up-a-distill-blog-with-netlify/#step-8-deploy-your-website){target=\"_blank\"}).\nI just logged into my Netlify account and went to my **Site Details** and\nobtained the following code from the **Status Badges** option.\n\n![Netlify Badge Code](images/step_03_netlify_01.png){#step-03-01-screenshot\nalt=\"Netlify Badge Code\" fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Netlify badge code\"\nfig-align=\"center\"}\n\nI copy-pasted the above code in at the top of my site `README.md` file. This\nlet's me quickly know whether my website is up and running as expected by simply\nchecking out my [github\npage](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<aside>\n\n**Note:** You can see my `README.md` with these settings\n[here](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/README.md)\n\n</aside>\n\n## Step 4: Add blog post sharing options\n\nIt is easy to configure distill to allow for easy sharing of posts using a\nvariety of social media platforms. I allow for **twitter, linkedin, pinterest,\nand facebook.** I did this by simply adding the following line in the\n`_site.yml` file:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncollections:\n  posts:\n    share: [twitter, linkedin, pinterest, facebook]\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow the following sharing options appear at the bottom of every post:\n\n![Distill Sharing Options](images/step_04_sharing_01.png){#step-04-01-screenshot\nalt=\"Distill Sharing Options\" fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Distill sharing options\"\nfig-align=\"center\"}\n\nI also added in the following lines to `_site.yml` to ensure that [twitter\ncards](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/metadata.html#twitter-card){target=\"_blank\"}\nare correctly generated when posts are shared on twitter:\n\n<aside>\n\n**Note:** You can see my `_site.yml` with these settings\n[here](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/_site.yml)\n\n</aside>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ntwitter:\n  site: \"@shamindraas\"\n  creator: \"@shamindraas\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Step 5: Add Corrections/Change Tracking and RSS feed\n\nI frequently make edits to blogposts and intend to do so going forward.\nFortunately `distill` makes it easy **track changes/corrections** made to\nblogposts. I did this by simply adding the site repo url to the `_site.yml` as\nfollows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nrepository_url: https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow the following appears at the bottom of all blogposts:\n\n![Changes and Corrections\nTracking](images/step_05_trackcorr_01.png){#step-05-01-screenshot\nalt=\"Changes and Corrections Tracking\"\nfig-alt=\"Screenshot of changes and corrections tracking\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nSo users can easily track changes or file any concerns as issues, though\nhopefully the `Disqus` comment feature makes this easier for everyone.\n\nFinally it is easy to add an **RSS feed** for the blog by simply adding the\nfollowing to `_site.yml`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nbase_url: https://www.shamindras.com/\nnavbar:\n  left:\n    - icon: fa fa-rss\n      href: index.xml\n```\n:::\n\n\n<aside>\n\n**Note:** You can see my `_site.yml` with these settings\n[here](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/_site.yml)\n\n</aside>\n\nThe critical elements are adding in the `base_url` fields and adding in\n`fa fa-rss` which is derived from the `index.xml` file. The `index.xml` file is\nautomatically generated from the `index.Rmd` when you render the `distill` blog\nusing the usual command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nrmarkdown::render_site(here::here())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn terms of core `distill` blog settings, these are the main options that I'm\nhappy to implement for now. For me the next steps are more about **customizing\nmy own blog workflow**. This will involve setting up utilities to automatically:\n\n-   **Wrap Rmd files** to 80 characters for consistency\n-   Quickly **delete unused files** e.g. `DS_Store` files on mac\n-   **Clear knitr cache** for all posts and thoroughly re-render the site\n\nI expect to do this using a combination of `R` functions/`Makefile` workflow,\nbut do stay tuned!\n\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nAs it can be seen it is quite easy to customize `distill` for commonly required\nfeatures. Really great work by the RStudio team in making such customizations so\nuser-friendly 👍.\n",
