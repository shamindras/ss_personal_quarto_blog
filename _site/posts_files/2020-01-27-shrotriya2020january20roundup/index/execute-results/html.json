Similar to \n[last time](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-09-19-shrotriya2019september19roundup/){target=\"_blank\"}\nI'm going to experiment with documenting anything interesting I come\nacross (articles, lectures, books, papers etc.) and any activities I get up to.\nThis is more for my personal benefit but may also help others.\n\n## Interesting Articles\n\n- Came across this [nice article on `R` error handling](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/check-yo-data-before-you-wreck-yo-results-53f0e919d0b9){target=\"_blank\"}. See here for the [original source](https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1/status/1221932342102646784).\n\n    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>\n    \n    - This the latest post from the [ACLU Tech & Analytics blog](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics){target=\"_blank\"}. This post explains\n    the key focus of the ACLU analytics team on having clean data pipelines and\n    using testing and assertions to facilitate this process\n    - Using functions like `assertthat::noNA(df$source)` will return a `FALSE`\n    if in fact there are no `NA` values in the `df$source` column. This seems\n    like a very useful function to use in `%>%` operations in my pipelines!\n    \n    - Used in combination with `assertthat::noNA(df$source)` will return the \n    actual observations that have `NA` values, which is super useful!\n    \n    - These operations are `%>%` friendly and can be used to verify join \n    operations perform as expected, for example:\n    \n      >  Does the join have the same number of rows as the original left-hand \n      table or did the data structure of the right-hand table create new rows?\n      \n      > How much of the right-hand table of the join falls away in the left join?\n      \n    - These checks are notably useful for the ACLU to also check for missingness\n    in their data pipelines. They note:\n    \n      >  A helpful check to assess whether missingness grossly misrepresents \n      our results is to quantify the severity of the problem. What level of \n      missingness are we willing to live with?\n      \n    - This definitely seems useful to me, as I use ad-hoc approaches to these\n    same issues e.g. `na.omit` without doing thorough assertions. Perhaps using\n    this with `tidylog` will be useful in doing EDA. Let's try and revisit this.      \n    \n    </details>\n\n- This is a really insightful article on [A regular personâ€™s guide to outbreak preparedness](https://medium.com/@EpiEllie/a-regular-persons-guide-to-outbreak-preparedness-5cece749123){target=\"_blank\"}, [by Prof. Eleanor Murray](https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1222173158230450176):\n\n    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>\n    \n    - In the event of well publicized (ready mass hysteria) virus spreads such\n    as the recent Coronavirus outbreak, it is important to listen to level-headed\n    healthcare professionals. In this case it is Prof. Elie Murray, an \n    epidimiologist from Boston University\n    - Since I'm definitely a newbie to understanding this epidemic, I found this\n    to be a very pragmatic guide to help prepare and prevent any further spread\n    of such diseases\n    - In terms of general healthy practices in the outbreak the key takeaways\n    are to:\n      - Wash your hands regularly\n      - Focus on improving the immune system\n      - Try to not catch other infections, and ensure you recover well from any\n      existing infections\n      - Donâ€™t panic\n      \n    - In terms of good practices to do in the event that you are sick, \n    the key takeaways are to:\n      - Stay home and recover\n      - Cover your mouth e.g. sneeze into the inner elbow\n      - Call a medical professional if you or a relative was in Wuhan recently\n      - Seek urgent medical care if you feel really sick\n    \n    - Please read the article on more detail on each\n    of the above points and also to considerations for high risk individuals,\n    a sick family member/friend, and if you are a healthcare responder\n    \n    - Overall, great practical advice! It is great to see statisticians such\n    as Prof. Murray take the lead and address the community at large with their\n    knowledge and expertise, when we live in an era of misinformation\n    \n    - I enjoyed the emphasisis on solving this challenge (like many others) as\n    a community\n    \n    </details>\n\n## Teaching\n\n- I'm a TA for the STAT 36-350, the _undergraduate_ statiscal computing course \nat CMU. This is a welcome change of pace from my [previous TA assignment](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-09-19-shrotriya2019september19roundup/#teaching){target=\"_blank\"} taught by [Prof. Freeman](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/){target=\"_blank\"}, with whom I had\nthe pleasure of teaching the course in Spring 2019. \n- This time we have around 150 students and, as Head-TA, I have the pleasure of \nmanaging a motivated team of 9 graduate and undergraduate TAs. \nHere's to a wonderful teaching and research semester ðŸ’¯.\n",
