This is more for my personal\nbenefit but may also help others. Let's see how this experiment goes!\n\n## Interesting Articles\n\n- Came across this [exhaustive `BibTex` example file](http://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/base/xampl.bib){target=\"_blank\"}\nwhich will be a really handy reference going forward for $\\LaTeX$ documents\n\n- This [Pimp my RMD: a few tips for R Markdown](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#highlight_a_piece_of_text){target=\"_blank\"} document is a very good site to help deal with really slick\nfeatures of editing `Rmd` documents.\n    - One nice feature I noticed was to use `HTML` to [center an image](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#center_an_image){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Interesting Books\n\n### Non-fiction\n\n- Continued reading this fantastic book [@steele2004cauchyscwarzmaster_book] called the *Art of Mathematical inequalities* by [Prof. Michael Steele](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/){target=\"_blank\"}. This book is simply\namazing in that Prof. Steele walks through deriving mathematical inequalities\nas if you were having a casual chat together using a whiteboard. I've been\nworking through through the problems in detail and they are a great challenge!\nI'll blog more about this as I finish the book in the August 2019 roundup.\n\n<aside> __Note:__ the text contains full solutions making it ideal for\nself-study (but I refuse to peek for now) </aside>\n\n### Fiction\n\n- Read Celeste Ng's [Everything I Never Told You](https://www.celesteng.com/everything-i-never-told-you){target=\"_blank\"}. Very nicely\nwritten debut novel by Ng, though quite dark and brooding in tone. Would not\nrecommend as a pick me up but certainly would for a nice American-Asian\ncharacter study set in the 1970s.\n\n## Interesting Papers\n\n- Particularly enjoyed reading this paper on the mathematical description of the carbon cycle\n[@rothman14_earth_carbon_cycle]. Really useful to get a good idea of the simple\nbut powerful use of simple stochastic differential equations used to model\nclimate change processes at various *global scales*.\n\n## Personal Blogging\n\nBesides this post üòÑ the main things I got up to on the\npersonal blogging front were:\n\n- Setting up this very blog, with a [detailed step-by-step guide](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-11-setting-up-a-distill-blog-with-netlify/){target=\"_blank\"} on the fun setup process with the [RStudio distill package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html){target=\"_blank\"} and\nalso [Netlify](https://netlify.com){target=\"_blank\"} and [Google\nDomains](https://domains.google){target=\"_blank\"}\n- Wrote a [fun blogpost](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/){target=\"_blank\"} on solving a couple of quick text-based tasks\nusing the `tidyverse` including [generating Oxford Comma\ntriples](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/#task-1-generating-oxford-comma-triples){target=\"_blank\"}\nand also [Generating numbered BibTeX\nentries](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/#task-2-generating-numbered-bibtex-entries){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nOverall July 2019 was a somewhat productive summer month. Though things are\nnever quite as productive as I like them to be in graduate school, but always\ngot to keep trying.\n\nI liked documenting this personal __July 2019 roundup__. Normally I'm not the\ntype to share much about my personal life, but I thought documenting what I get\nup to gives me more stake in the respective activities and forces me to commit\nto them enthusiastically. I also like sharing cool stuff that I come across\nwith friends, so dual benefit.\n\nI think I'll keep these monthly roundups going for a while. Let's see how this\nexperiment goes when semester starts üòÑ.\n\nPlease post in the comments any questions/feedback you may have or anything\ninteresting resources you came across in July 2019 üëç.\n",
