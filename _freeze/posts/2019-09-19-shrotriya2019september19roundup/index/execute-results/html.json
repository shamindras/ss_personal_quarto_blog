Similar to [last\n                                                time](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-09-01-shrotriya2019august19roundup/){target=\"_blank\"}\nI'm going to experiment with, namely documenting anything interesting I come\nacross (articles, lectures, books, papers etc.) and any activities I get up to.\nThis is more for my personal benefit but may also help others.\n\n## Interesting Articles\n\n- Came across this [amazing guide to reading an R help file](https://socviz.co/appendix.html#a-little-more-about-r){target=\"_blank\"}. Experienced `R` users can use this fantastic pedagogical tool by [Kieran Healy](https://twitter.com/kjhealy){target=\"_blank\"} to teach new `R` users\non how to read internal `R` help documentation.\n- Came across this [fascinating article on how calorie burning being a chess grandmaster is](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/27593253/why-grandmasters-magnus-carlsen-fabiano-caruana-lose-weight-playing-chess){target=\"_blank\"} by \n[Aishwarya Kumar](https://twitter.com/kumaraishwarya){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>\n    \n    - Article notes that chess grandmasters can burn as much as 6000 calories\n    individually during an intense day of sedentary chess playing!\n    - Initial focus is on Fabiano Caruana, an American grandmaster in chess, and\n    current world No. 2. Caruana has to maintain a very strict diet and exercise\n    routine, particularly during tournaments\n    - Primary reasons for the calorie loss are heavy mental stress of the tournament, constantly thinking of chess, thus leaving limited time to think about and consume food\n    \n    - Interesting quote:\n    \n    > ...India's first grandmaster, Viswanathan Anand, does two hours of cardio each night to tire himself out so he doesn't dream about chess\n    \n    - Magnus Carlsen, reigning No. 1, for example consulted a professional\n    nutritionist who recommended that he stop drinking orange juice (to avoid \n    sugar spikes) and replace it with a less sugary regular/chocolate milk\n    blend\n    \n    - Carlsen has also optimized _sitting_. This is quite amazing and something to\n    think about personally as someone who spends many hours daily in front of a\n    screen\n    \n    - Carlsen has also undertaken _load management_ (minimizing competitions\n    participated) to increase the amount of recuperation time between \n    tournaments\n    \n    - In short, there are a lot of parallels to the research life which I \n    undertake, and a lot of useful tips to optimize energy and time spent doing\n    what I enjoy for longer\n    \n    </details>\n\n- This is a really insightful interview with [Hadley Wickham](https://qz.com/1661487/hadley-wickham-on-the-future-of-r-python-and-the-tidyverse/){target=\"_blank\"}, a recent [COPSS award winner](http://bulletin.imstat.org/2019/09/copss-presidents-award-hadley-wickham/){target=\"_blank\"}, on the future of the `R` programming language:\n\n    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>\n    \n    - Wickham notes that `R` vs `Python` language wars are not constructive in\n    moving data science and other fields forward. \n    \n    - I agree wholeheartedly on this and firmly believe in using the best tools \n    for the statistical job at hand. What should matter are more critical\n    aspects like code readability, usability, and reproducibility in light of \n    the given task\n    \n    - Interestingly Wickham notes:\n    \n    > A pattern that I see is that the data science team in a company uses R and the data engineering team uses Python\n    \n    - Wickham also has focused on bridging divides within the `R` community\n    itself, namely in developing the `dtplyr` package to convert `dplyr` code\n    to the alternative `data.table` package syntax. This is a promising direction\n    ahead where `tidyverse` and `data.table` users can collaborate much more\n    easily\n    - There is also a focus on encouraging diversity in `R` usage and actively\n    developing communities. He asks:\n    \n    > Can we take the R-Ladies model and help other groups that are currently underserved?\n    \n    - Overall it is good that Wickham was recognized recently with the famous\n    COPSS medal in statistics and that the community is embracing software\n    development and design as a key aspect of our profession. It seems that the\n    future is bright for statistics!\n    \n    </details>\n\n- This is a [nice blogpost on making modular `Rmarkdown` files ](https://martinctc.github.io/blog/first-world-problems-very-long-rmarkdown-documents/){target=\"_blank\"}. In fact this modular `Rmd` approach is now used in [my blog for common footer files](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1.Rmd#L244){target=\"_blank\"}. Did not realize how nicely the `here` package works with references in `Rmd` chunks.\n\n## Interesting Presentations\n- This thoughtful \n[presentation on Design at Quora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWaoNNAuhBI){target=\"_blank\"} by\n[Rebecca Cox](https://twitter.com/artypapers?lang=en){target=\"_blank\"} \n(VP of design at Quora). I've summarized what I feel are the key points from \nthis important presentation below.\n\n    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>\n    \n    - Cox notes that it is a \"great time to be a designer\" because design\n    has proven again and again to be a clear competitive advantage in tech\n    - She notes her awareness of Quora's apparent minimalist design interface\n    i.e. dark, red, and text heavy\n    - Cox asks - what is Design? Some say it is the visual style, for some the\n    user interaction, and for others \"it begins and ends with the logo\"\n    - For Cox, her definition is abstract, and summarized as:\n    \n    > The set of decisions about a product\n    \n    - Not just an interface, logo etc. Designing is about making product\n    decisions\n    - Benefits of this broad _decision-driven_ definition for Quora are:\n      - A clear relationship between the product and the interface i.e. why\n      should a dropdown even exist?\n      - Concentrates attention on where it matters most i.e. company goals\n      - Enables a role within Quora that balances authority and responsibility\n      i.e. Designers should do more than \"apply a coat of paint to a feature\n      at the end\"\n      \n    - To Cox:\n    \n    > Great design is all the work you don't ask people who use your products\n    to do\n    \n    - There are a lot of deep direct applications to my statistics research\n    i.e. ensure all theoretical and empirical tools are seamlessly able to be\n    conveyed to end users in science, industry, or academia.\n    \n    - I will be coming back to this over time periodically and reflect if \n    I have undertaken this definition of design and applied it in my work and\n    daily life\n    \n    </details>\n    \n- This is a [really inspiring presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/r-at-the-aclu-joining-tables-to-to-reunite-families?utm_content=buffer4211f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer){target=\"_blank\"} on how data science is used at the ACLU specifically in the recent border immigration policies [by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu](https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>\n    \n    - Utilizing `tidyverse` to sort through messy data linkage issues \n    in a consistent framework is well thought out by the team with useful \n    packaged functions created for use by the wider ACLU team\n    - Here both statistics and law are used to tackle a major humanitarian \n    issue i.e. child border separation. This is deeply inspiring and the kind \n    of applied work that I would like to contribute to meaningfully in the future\n    - I particularly appreciated the general data source skepticism showed by \n    the ACLU team. As a statistician it is important to not only explore data\n    but be very skeptical of the source quality i.e. competing legal bodies may\n    not provide the ACLU unbiased data!\n    \n    </details>\n\n## Teaching\n- I'm a TA for the [amazing graduate statiscal computing course at CMU](https://36-750.github.io){target=\"_blank\"}. This is an intensive (but very\nrewarding) programming course designed by CMU statistics professors [Alex Reinhart](https://www.refsmmat.com/){target=\"_blank\"} and \n[Chris Genovese](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~genovese/?p=research){target=\"_blank\"}. I\nhighly recommend checking out this course website as a general programming \nreference in daily work/research. I know that I certainly will be \nðŸ˜„.\n",
