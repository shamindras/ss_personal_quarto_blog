I'm **Shamindra Shrotriya**, a graduate student in the [Department of\nStatistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at the\nwonderful [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).\nI've decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in\nstatistics as a graduate student.\n\nI'd like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to read\nabout in the statistics and machine learning space (**statistical\ntheory/methodology**, **research**, **rstats**, **python** ...) as well as\nanything else I am generally into e.g. **books**, **sports** etc.\n\nFeel free to pull up a chair, leave a comment, and join me so that we can\nexplore together.\n\nYou can also learn more about me from my\n[CV](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/CV.pdf){target=\"_blank\"},\n[rÃ©sumÃ©](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/resume.pdf){target=\"_blank\"},\nand [open-source\nsoftware](https://www.shamindras.com/software.html){target=\"_blank\"}\ncontributions.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe credit to starting this blog goes to the following people. I hope to not\ndisappoint and create some useful content here ðŸ––.\n\n-   The [Rstudio team](https://www.rstudio.com/){target=\"_blank\"} - for\n    co-developing the fantastic [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/){target=\"_blank\"}\n    package upon which this site is based.\n-   [Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/) for posting this [fantastic blog\n    post](http://www.fast.ai/2017/04/06/alternatives/){target=\"_blank\"}\n    encouraging people like me to (finally!) create a blog\n-   **My parents** for encouraging to communicate my passion for statistics. I\n    secretly think that this is their way of minimizing my passionate rants\n    about the bootstrap in our regular Skype chats (the rants will still\n    continue though...ðŸ˜„).\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nI'd like to thank Salil Shrotriya for taking my profile pic which is the preview\nimage for this post.",
