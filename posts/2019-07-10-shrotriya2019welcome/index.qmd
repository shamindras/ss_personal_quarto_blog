## Welcome - Let's Get Statistical!

Hi there! I'm **Shamindra Shrotriya**, a graduate student in the [Department of
Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at the
wonderful [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
I've decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in
statistics as a graduate student.

I'd like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to read
about in the statistics and machine learning space (**statistical
theory/methodology**, **research**, **rstats**, **python** ...) as well as
anything else I am generally into e.g. **books**, **sports** etc.

Feel free to pull up a chair, leave a comment, and join me so that we can
explore together.

You can also learn more about me from my
[CV](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/CV.pdf){target="_blank"},
[résumé](https://www.shamindras.com/data/pdfs/resume.pdf){target="_blank"},
and [open-source
software](https://www.shamindras.com/software.html){target="_blank"}
contributions.

## Credits

The credit to starting this blog goes to the following people. I hope to not
disappoint and create some useful content here `r emo::ji("vulcan_salute")`.

-   The [Rstudio team](https://www.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} - for
    co-developing the fantastic [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"}
    package upon which this site is based.
-   [Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/) for posting this [fantastic blog
    post](http://www.fast.ai/2017/04/06/alternatives/){target="_blank"}
    encouraging people like me to (finally!) create a blog
-   **My parents** for encouraging to communicate my passion for statistics. I
    secretly think that this is their way of minimizing my passionate rants
    about the bootstrap in our regular Skype chats (the rants will still
    continue though...`r emo::ji("smile")`).
