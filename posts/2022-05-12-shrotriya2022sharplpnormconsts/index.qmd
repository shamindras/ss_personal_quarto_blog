# TL;DR

I walk through a cool and possibly less known result for sharp bounds on $\ell_{p}$ 
norms in finite dimensional vector spaces. This result enables working with 
$\ell_{p}$-norms directly rather than approximating them with with more widely 
used $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$, and $\ell_{\infty}$-norms, for example.
This exposition is based on [Chapter 2, @holger2018numericallinalg]
^[__Note:__ The presentation in this post is ___intentionally___ verbose. The goal
is to give lots of intuition of the key result and its usefulness, and ensure
that the proofs are rigorous. It is written with an empathetic mindset to
newcomers, and to myself for future reference.].

<aside>
[@holger2018numericallinalg] is a wonderful (numerical) linear algebra book,
highly recommend it `r emo::ji("100")`!

## $\ell_{p}$-norm on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$

Throughout this presentation we will work in the finite dimensional Euclidean 
space $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, for some __fixed__ $d \in \mathbb{N}$. Moreover we will
we will use the $\ell_{p}$-norm on this space, which is defined as follows:

## $\ell_{p}$-norm on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$

For a fixed $p \in [1, \infty]$, the $\ell_{p}$-norm as
denoted by $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\ell_{p}}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, is defined as follows:
$$
\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert_{\ell_{p}} := \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{d} |x_{i} |^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}, \; \text{for each $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$}
$$ {#eq-lp-norm-01}

__Note:__ Sometimes @def-lp-norm is also just called the $p$-norm in many 
textbooks, and has the abbreviated notation $\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert_{p}$.
We will use this notation going forward.

We note (without proof) that @def-lp-norm does indeed define a valid norm on 
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$. A previous post showed more of these details. A more detailed 
proof of this can be found in TODO.

## Warm up: Relationships between $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$, and $\ell_{\infty}$-norms

Our goal will be to prove bounds for ___any___ $p \in [1, \infty]$. However, we 
we get our bearings by first shifting focus on the three most commonly used $\ell_{p}$-norms on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. These are the $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$, and $\ell_{\infty}$-norms.
The main proposition is as follows:

## $\ell_{p}$-norm on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$

For a fixed $p \in [1, \infty]$, the $\ell_{p}$-norm as
denoted by $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\ell_{p}}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, is defined as follows:
$$
\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert_{\ell_{p}} := \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{d} |x_{i} |^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}, \; \text{for each $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$}
