## Introduction

Welcome to the August 2019 roundup! Similar to [last
time](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-30-shrotriya2019july19roundup/){target="_blank"}
I'm going to experiment with, namely documenting anything interesting I come
across (articles, lectures, books, papers etc.) and any activities I get up to.
This is more for my personal benefit but may also help others.

## Interesting Articles

-   Came across this [exhaustive `BibTeX` example
    file](http://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/base/xampl.bib){target="_blank"}
    which will be a really handy reference going forward for $\LaTeX$ documents
-   The document is written by the Oren Patashnik, the co-creator of BibTeX
    (`r emo::ji("wow")`) and the co-author of the great book
    [@grahamknuthpatashnik1994concrete_book]

## Interesting Books

### Fiction

-   Started reading this fantastic book [@granville2019primesuspects_book]
    called the *Prime Suspects* by **Andrew Granville, Jennifer Granville, and
    Robert J. Lewis (illustrator)**. Here is a [youtube trailer for the
    book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82c2HDp-ntg&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank"}
    to get you excited!

Key Takeaways

</summary>

-   This is essentially an introduction to analytic number theory disguised as a
    fast-moving graphic novel murder mystery
-   For any mathematics fans (who isn't though?) there are lots of funny easter
    eggs to be found in the frame backgrounds
-   This a very unique exposition on number theory, a subject in which I have
    negligible knowledge (like most subjects)
-   The pedagogy is gentle and yet exciting emphasizing not just mathematics but
    the importance of communication of mathematical ideas to the wider public
    i.e. a meta novel if you like
-   I hope to see more books in this mathematical graphic novel genre. The last
    one I read (and know of) is Logicomix [@doxiadis2009logicomix_book] which I
    highly recommend as well for anyone wishing to venture into the mysteries of
    infinity!

## Interesting Interviews

-   Really enjoyed [this
    interview](http://www.careeryoga.life/440ebcdf?fbclid=IwAR2BWeyMdhTg2fbdHp5U-D9gCy2oqLZBk2ljRBMhjtyAEtSgqBCt7kMlSFk)
    with Prof. Noga Alon a leading mathematician specializing in combinatorics,
    graph theory etc. Fantastic insights into the life of a (leading)
    theoretical researcher and certainly someone for me to look up to and learn
    from. I enjoyed the fact that it was so brief but dense as I normally don't
    have much time for podcasts. I may check out a few more scientific based
    interviews from this [Career Yoga podcast](http://www.careeryoga.life/)
    going forward.

**Note:** This interview was co-conducted Ms. Narkis Alon, the daughter of Prof.
Alon which led to a really personal dynamic!

Key Takeaways

</summary>

-   This 20min interview is really part of a podcast on careers, and the focus
    here being the lessons/insights learned from a very successful career in
    theoretical mathematical research from Prof. Alon
-   Prof. Alon appears to be extremely organized in all aspects of life,
    including packing for trips. Was asked specifically not to prepare for this
    interview `r emo::ji("smile")`
-   I've paraphrased my summaries below, any transcription errors are mine.
    Please listen to the original interview.
-   Question: What does it mean to be a mathematician?

> To mostly think about mathematical problems, there are many mathematical
> problems that have rich history, many are interesting in their own sense. It
> means to ask the right questions, think about interesting questions and tell
> the difference between what is beautiful and what is not beautiful

-   Question: What does your day look like?

> Many procedural things - teaching, meeting graduate students, reading
> mathematical papers.

> Part of the time I'm just thinking! Sometimes with other people over
> chalkboard/whiteboard, looking at a piece of paper on the table i.e. trying to
> do some computations that are relevant, thinking of relationships to the
> problem. Finding problems that are similar enough.

-   Question: It is so difficult to grasp the idea of just thinking! Most of the
    careers are based on the idea of responding to things. Often when visiting
    you in Princeton it seems you are in a room staring in the air, in another
    room people another mathematician is staring in the air, it seems like you
    are not doing anything!

> Right, and indeed in much of time you are not doing anything. **Most of the
> time you are failing and you need to get used to to it** Part of the
> satisfaction is this process is to think about something for a very long time
> without having an idea. Sometimes you solve something related

-   Question: Do you sometimes try to initiate situations that will inspire you
    to solve problems

> You go to conferences, talk to people, read papers etc. Many times you just
> need to be in a different state of mind e.g. if you forget someones name, just
> thinking about it does not always make you remember, just need to try
> something else at times. This may explain why you see people staring in the
> air! Sometimes you can go and take walks.

-   Question: When did you know you wanted to be a mathematician?

> As a child, before I was 10 years old I knew I was interested in mathematical
> puzzles. I was good at it and interested in mathematics but didn't really know
> what it involved. I always liked that it is **objective**. I was able to
> explain a solution to an adult at a party on the puzzle of the Eurovision song
> contest. The power of convincing someone is really powerful.

-   Question: Was the long list of awards you aimed for?

> No, it's nice to get such prizes but never done this with the intent. In every
> field it is important, but the glory is very limited. This is nice but you
> don't do things with this aim in mind

-   Question: In one of your discoveries, did you ever feel "this was something
    I was dreaming on and I accomplished that"

> I had a few things where I was very happy. Because I had thought about it for
> a long time and found something new. Don't think I had a specific time where I
> sat back and said this is the best discovery of their life. One should always
> think that the best discoveries are ahead of them.

-   Question: What do mathematicians do after leaving research?

> Some scientists go into scientific management. Some go into industry, but this
> is rare. As long as what I do is what I find interesting and challenging, and
> what I do is not as good as my best results I would still keep doing this.

-   Question: Does being a grandfather and becoming older change your priorities
    and motivation?

> Yes, in general you realize you want to spend time with family, children, and
> grandchildren. I don't think it comes **instead** of science. I hope to keep
> doing good work and spend time with family.

## Personal Blogging

Besides this post `r emo::ji("smile")` the main things I got up to on the
personal blogging front were:

-   Updating the distill blog settings, with a [detailed step-by-step
    guide](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-31-shrotriya2019distillpt2/){target="_blank"}
-   Wrote another [fun
    blogpost](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-21-shrotriya2019reprtitanic/){target="_blank"}
    on using the `tidyverse` to reproduce a plot on the survivorship of the
    Titanic. Always so cool to be able to reproduce such famous plots using
    modern tools.

## Concluding Thoughts

Overall August 2019 was the end of summer and the start of a new year of
graduate school - yay!

Please feel free to leave a comment if you found any useful articles, lectures,
books, papers etc which I may find interesting.
