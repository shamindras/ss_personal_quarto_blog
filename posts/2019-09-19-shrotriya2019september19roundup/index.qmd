## Introduction

Welcome to the September 2019 roundup! Similar to [last
                                                time](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-09-01-shrotriya2019august19roundup/){target="_blank"}
I'm going to experiment with, namely documenting anything interesting I come
across (articles, lectures, books, papers etc.) and any activities I get up to.
This is more for my personal benefit but may also help others.

## Interesting Articles

- Came across this [amazing guide to reading an R help file](https://socviz.co/appendix.html#a-little-more-about-r){target="_blank"}. Experienced `R` users can use this fantastic pedagogical tool by [Kieran Healy](https://twitter.com/kjhealy){target="_blank"} to teach new `R` users
on how to read internal `R` help documentation.
- Came across this [fascinating article on how calorie burning being a chess grandmaster is](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/27593253/why-grandmasters-magnus-carlsen-fabiano-caruana-lose-weight-playing-chess){target="_blank"} by 
[Aishwarya Kumar](https://twitter.com/kumaraishwarya){target="_blank"}

    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>
    
    - Article notes that chess grandmasters can burn as much as 6000 calories
    individually during an intense day of sedentary chess playing!
    - Initial focus is on Fabiano Caruana, an American grandmaster in chess, and
    current world No. 2. Caruana has to maintain a very strict diet and exercise
    routine, particularly during tournaments
    - Primary reasons for the calorie loss are heavy mental stress of the tournament, constantly thinking of chess, thus leaving limited time to think about and consume food
    
    - Interesting quote:
    
    > ...India's first grandmaster, Viswanathan Anand, does two hours of cardio each night to tire himself out so he doesn't dream about chess
    
    - Magnus Carlsen, reigning No. 1, for example consulted a professional
    nutritionist who recommended that he stop drinking orange juice (to avoid 
    sugar spikes) and replace it with a less sugary regular/chocolate milk
    blend
    
    - Carlsen has also optimized _sitting_. This is quite amazing and something to
    think about personally as someone who spends many hours daily in front of a
    screen
    
    - Carlsen has also undertaken _load management_ (minimizing competitions
    participated) to increase the amount of recuperation time between 
    tournaments
    
    - In short, there are a lot of parallels to the research life which I 
    undertake, and a lot of useful tips to optimize energy and time spent doing
    what I enjoy for longer

- This is a really insightful interview with [Hadley Wickham](https://qz.com/1661487/hadley-wickham-on-the-future-of-r-python-and-the-tidyverse/){target="_blank"}, a recent [COPSS award winner](http://bulletin.imstat.org/2019/09/copss-presidents-award-hadley-wickham/){target="_blank"}, on the future of the `R` programming language:

    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>
    
    - Wickham notes that `R` vs `Python` language wars are not constructive in
    moving data science and other fields forward. 
    
    - I agree wholeheartedly on this and firmly believe in using the best tools 
    for the statistical job at hand. What should matter are more critical
    aspects like code readability, usability, and reproducibility in light of 
    the given task
    
    - Interestingly Wickham notes:
    
    > A pattern that I see is that the data science team in a company uses R and the data engineering team uses Python
    
    - Wickham also has focused on bridging divides within the `R` community
    itself, namely in developing the `dtplyr` package to convert `dplyr` code
    to the alternative `data.table` package syntax. This is a promising direction
    ahead where `tidyverse` and `data.table` users can collaborate much more
    easily
    - There is also a focus on encouraging diversity in `R` usage and actively
    developing communities. He asks:
    
    > Can we take the R-Ladies model and help other groups that are currently underserved?
    
    - Overall it is good that Wickham was recognized recently with the famous
    COPSS medal in statistics and that the community is embracing software
    development and design as a key aspect of our profession. It seems that the
    future is bright for statistics!

- This is a [nice blogpost on making modular `Rmarkdown` files ](https://martinctc.github.io/blog/first-world-problems-very-long-rmarkdown-documents/){target="_blank"}. In fact this modular `Rmd` approach is now used in [my blog for common footer files](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_distill_blog/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1.Rmd#L244){target="_blank"}. Did not realize how nicely the `here` package works with references in `Rmd` chunks.

## Interesting Presentations
- This thoughtful 
[presentation on Design at Quora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWaoNNAuhBI){target="_blank"} by
[Rebecca Cox](https://twitter.com/artypapers?lang=en){target="_blank"} 
(VP of design at Quora). I've summarized what I feel are the key points from 
this important presentation below.

    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>
    
    - Cox notes that it is a "great time to be a designer" because design
    has proven again and again to be a clear competitive advantage in tech
    - She notes her awareness of Quora's apparent minimalist design interface
    i.e. dark, red, and text heavy
    - Cox asks - what is Design? Some say it is the visual style, for some the
    user interaction, and for others "it begins and ends with the logo"
    - For Cox, her definition is abstract, and summarized as:
    
    > The set of decisions about a product
    
    - Not just an interface, logo etc. Designing is about making product
    decisions
    - Benefits of this broad _decision-driven_ definition for Quora are:
      - A clear relationship between the product and the interface i.e. why
      should a dropdown even exist?
      - Concentrates attention on where it matters most i.e. company goals
      - Enables a role within Quora that balances authority and responsibility
      i.e. Designers should do more than "apply a coat of paint to a feature
      at the end"
      
    - To Cox:
    
    > Great design is all the work you don't ask people who use your products
    to do
    
    - There are a lot of deep direct applications to my statistics research
    i.e. ensure all theoretical and empirical tools are seamlessly able to be
    conveyed to end users in science, industry, or academia.
    
    - I will be coming back to this over time periodically and reflect if 
    I have undertaken this definition of design and applied it in my work and
    daily life

- This is a [really inspiring presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/r-at-the-aclu-joining-tables-to-to-reunite-families?utm_content=buffer4211f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer){target="_blank"} on how data science is used at the ACLU specifically in the recent border immigration policies [by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu](https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1){target="_blank"}.

    <details> <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>
    
    - Utilizing `tidyverse` to sort through messy data linkage issues 
    in a consistent framework is well thought out by the team with useful 
    packaged functions created for use by the wider ACLU team
    - Here both statistics and law are used to tackle a major humanitarian 
    issue i.e. child border separation. This is deeply inspiring and the kind 
    of applied work that I would like to contribute to meaningfully in the future
    - I particularly appreciated the general data source skepticism showed by 
    the ACLU team. As a statistician it is important to not only explore data
    but be very skeptical of the source quality i.e. competing legal bodies may
    not provide the ACLU unbiased data!

## Teaching
- I'm a TA for the [amazing graduate statiscal computing course at CMU](https://36-750.github.io){target="_blank"}. This is an intensive (but very
rewarding) programming course designed by CMU statistics professors [Alex Reinhart](https://www.refsmmat.com/){target="_blank"} and 
[Chris Genovese](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~genovese/?p=research){target="_blank"}. I
highly recommend checking out this course website as a general programming 
reference in daily work/research. I know that I certainly will be 
`r emo::ji("smile")`.
