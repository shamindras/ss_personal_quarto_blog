## Introduction

This is a new feature I'm going to experiment with, namely documenting anything
interesting I come across (articles, lectures, books, papers
                                              etc.) and any activities I get up to. This is more for my personal
benefit but may also help others. Let's see how this experiment goes!

## Interesting Articles

- Came across this [exhaustive `BibTex` example file](http://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/base/xampl.bib){target="_blank"}
which will be a really handy reference going forward for $\LaTeX$ documents

- This [Pimp my RMD: a few tips for R Markdown](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#highlight_a_piece_of_text){target="_blank"} document is a very good site to help deal with really slick
features of editing `Rmd` documents.
    - One nice feature I noticed was to use `HTML` to [center an image](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#center_an_image){target="_blank"}

## Interesting Books

### Non-fiction

- Continued reading this fantastic book [@steele2004cauchyscwarzmaster_book] called the *Art of Mathematical inequalities* by [Prof. Michael Steele](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/){target="_blank"}. This book is simply
amazing in that Prof. Steele walks through deriving mathematical inequalities
as if you were having a casual chat together using a whiteboard. I've been
working through through the problems in detail and they are a great challenge!
I'll blog more about this as I finish the book in the August 2019 roundup.

<aside> __Note:__ the text contains full solutions making it ideal for
self-study (but I refuse to peek for now) </aside>

### Fiction

- Read Celeste Ng's [Everything I Never Told You](https://www.celesteng.com/everything-i-never-told-you){target="_blank"}. Very nicely
written debut novel by Ng, though quite dark and brooding in tone. Would not
recommend as a pick me up but certainly would for a nice American-Asian
character study set in the 1970s.

## Interesting Papers

- Particularly enjoyed reading this paper on the mathematical description of the carbon cycle
[@rothman14_earth_carbon_cycle]. Really useful to get a good idea of the simple
but powerful use of simple stochastic differential equations used to model
climate change processes at various *global scales*.

## Personal Blogging

Besides this post `r emo::ji("smile")` the main things I got up to on the
personal blogging front were:

- Setting up this very blog, with a [detailed step-by-step guide](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-11-setting-up-a-distill-blog-with-netlify/){target="_blank"} on the fun setup process with the [RStudio distill package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html){target="_blank"} and
also [Netlify](https://netlify.com){target="_blank"} and [Google
Domains](https://domains.google){target="_blank"}
- Wrote a [fun blogpost](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/){target="_blank"} on solving a couple of quick text-based tasks
using the `tidyverse` including [generating Oxford Comma
triples](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/#task-1-generating-oxford-comma-triples){target="_blank"}
and also [Generating numbered BibTeX
entries](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-15-shrotriya2019tidyfunpt1/#task-2-generating-numbered-bibtex-entries){target="_blank"}

## Concluding Thoughts

Overall July 2019 was a somewhat productive summer month. Though things are
never quite as productive as I like them to be in graduate school, but always
got to keep trying.

I liked documenting this personal __July 2019 roundup__. Normally I'm not the
type to share much about my personal life, but I thought documenting what I get
up to gives me more stake in the respective activities and forces me to commit
to them enthusiastically. I also like sharing cool stuff that I come across
with friends, so dual benefit.

I think I'll keep these monthly roundups going for a while. Let's see how this
experiment goes when semester starts `r emo::ji("smile")`.

Please post in the comments any questions/feedback you may have or anything
interesting resources you came across in July 2019 `r emo::ji("thumbsup")`.
