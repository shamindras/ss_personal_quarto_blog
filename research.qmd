I'm a final year PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Data
Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon
University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by
[Prof. Matey Neykov](http://mateyneykov.com/).

Broadly speaking my primary research interests focus on 

> Developing various
generalizations of models and estimators in classical statistics, and analyzing their theoretical properties.

More specifically, the classical topics I study include **density estimation, isotonic
regression,** and **location-scale estimation**. I'm also actively interested in application-based methodology via
**statistical ranking** (in particular the *Bradley-Terry-Luce model*), and
**spatiotemporal modeling** (*wildfire prediction*).

I particularly enjoy the collaborative aspect of research, and I'm privileged to

## Abstract

The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is a popular statistical approach for
estimating the global ranking of a collection of items using pairwise
comparisons. To ensure accurate ranking, it is essential to obtain precise
estimates of the model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss. The difficulty
of this task depends crucially on the topology of the pairwise comparison graph
over the given items. However, beyond very few well-studied cases, such as the
complete and Erdös-Rényi comparison graphs, little is known about the
performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the BTL model
parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss under more general graph topologies.
In this paper, we derive novel, general upper bounds on the ℓ∞ estimation error
of the BTL MLE that depend explicitly on the algebraic connectivity of the
comparison graph, the maximal performance gap across items and the sample
complexity. We demonstrate that the derived bounds perform well and in some
cases are sharper compared to known results obtained using different loss
functions and more restricted assumptions and graph topologies. We carefully
compare our results to `Yan et al. (2012)`, which is closest in spirit to our
work. We further provide minimax lower bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$-error that 
nearly match the upper bounds over a class of sufficiently regular graph
topologies. Finally, we study the implications of our $\ell_{\infty}$-bounds 
for efficient (offline) tournament design. We illustrate and discuss our 
findings through various examples and simulations.

## Abstract

We propose a time-varying generalization of the Bradley-Terry model that allows
for nonparametric modeling of dynamic global rankings of distinct teams. We
develop a novel estimator that relies on kernel smoothing to pre-process the
pairwise comparisons over time and is applicable in sparse settings where the
Bradley-Terry may not be fit. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for
the existence and uniqueness of our estimator. We also derive time-varying
oracle bounds for both the estimation error and the excess risk in the
model-agnostic setting where the Bradley-Terry model is not necessarily the true
data generating process. We thoroughly test the practical effectiveness of our
model using both simulated and real world data and suggest an efficient
data-driven approach for bandwidth tuning.

## Abstract

Wildfires are rare events that present severe threats to life and property.
Understanding their propagation is of key importance to mitigate and contain
their impact, especially since climate change is increasing their occurrence. We
propose an end-to-end sequential model of wildfire risk components, including
wildfire location, size, duration, and risk exposure. We do so through a
combination of marked spatio-temporal point processes and conditional density
estimation techniques. Unlike other approaches that use regression-based
methods, this approach allows both predictive accuracy and an associated
uncertainty measure for each risk estimate, accounting for the uncertainty in
prior model components. This is particularly beneficial for timely
decision-making by different wildfire risk management stakeholders. To allow us
to build our models without limiting them to a specific state or county, we have
collected open wildfire and climate data for the entire continental United
States. We are releasing this aggregated dataset to enable further open
research on wildfire models at a national scale.

___Revisiting Le Cam's Equation: Exact Minimax Rates over Convex Density Classes___
<br>
<u>Shamindra Shrotriya</u>, Matey Neykov (2022).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}

## Abstract

We study the classical problem of deriving minimax rates for density estimation
over convex density classes. Building on the pioneering work of `Le Cam (1973)`,
`Birge (1983, 1986)`, `Wong and Shen (1995)`, `Yang and Barron (1999)`, we
determine the exact (up to constants) minimax rate over any convex density
class. This work thus extends these known results by demonstrating that the
local metric entropy of the density class always captures the minimax optimal
rates under such settings. Our bounds provide a unifying perspective across both
parametric and nonparametric convex density classes, under weaker assumptions on
the richness of the density class than previously considered. Our proposed
'multistage sieve' MLE applies to any such convex density class. We apply our
risk bounds to rederive known minimax rates including bounded total variation,
and Holder density classes. We further illustrate the utility of the result by
deriving upper bounds for less studied classes, e.g., convex mixture of
densities. relevant trigger.

___Adversarial Sign-Corrupted Isotonic Regression___
<br>
<u>Shamindra Shrotriya</u>, Matey Neykov (2022).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}

## Abstract

Classical univariate isotonic regression involves nonparametric estimation under
a monotonicity constraint of the true signal. We consider a variation of this
generating process, which we term adversarial sign-corrupted isotonic (`ASCI`)
regression. Under this `ASCI` setting, the adversary has full access to the true
isotonic responses, and is free to sign-corrupt them. Estimating the true
monotonic signal given these sign-corrupted responses is a highly challenging
task. Notably, the sign-corruptions are designed to violate monotonicity, and
possibly induce heavy dependence between the corrupted response terms. In this
sense, `ASCI` regression may be viewed as an adversarial stress test for
isotonic regression. Our motivation is driven by understanding whether efficient
robust estimation of the monotone signal is feasible under this adversarial
setting. We develop `ASCIFIT`, a three-step estimation procedure under the
`ASCI` setting. The `ASCIFIT` procedure is conceptually simple, easy to
implement with existing software, and consists of applying the `PAVA` with
crucial pre- and post-processing corrections. We formalize this procedure, and
demonstrate its theoretical guarantees in the form of sharp high probability
upper bounds and minimax lower bounds. We illustrate our findings with detailed
simulations.

___maars: Tidy Inference under the 'Models as Approximations' Framework in R___
<br>
<u>Riccardo Fogliato</u>, <u>Shamindra Shrotriya</u>, Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla (2021).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}

## Abstract

Linear regression using ordinary least squares (OLS) is a critical part of every
statistician's toolkit. In `R`, this is elegantly implemented via `lm()` and its
related functions. However, the statistical inference output from this suite of
functions is based on the assumption that the model is well specified. This
assumption is often unrealistic and at best satisfied approximately. In the
statistics and econometrics literature, this has long been recognized and a
large body of work provides inference for OLS under more practical assumptions.
This can be seen as model-free inference. In this paper, we introduce our
package `maars` ("models as approximations") that aims at bringing research on
model-free inference to `R` via a comprehensive workflow. The `maars` package
differs from other packages that also implement variance estimationin three key
ways. First, all functions in `maars` follow a consistent grammar and return
output in tidy format, with minimal deviation from the typical `lm()` workflow.
Second, `maars` contains several tools for inference including empirical,
multiplier, residual bootstrap, and subsampling, for easy comparison. Third,
`maars` is developed with pedagogy in mind. For this, most of its functions
explicitly return the assumptions under which the output is valid. This key
innovation makes `maars` useful in teaching inference under misspecification and
also a powerful tool for applied researchers. We hope our default feature of
explicitly presenting assumptions will become a de facto standard for most
statistical modeling in `R`.

## Abstract

We propose a time-varying generalization of the original Bradley-Terry model.
Our model directly captures the temporal dependence structure of the pairwise
comparison data to model time-varying global rankings of N distinct objects. The
convex formulation enables efficient analysis on sparse time-varying pairwise
comparison data. Furthermore, depending on the choice of penalization norm, our
model effectively provides a control on the degree of smoothing in the
time-varying global rankings. We also prove that a relatively weak condition is
necessary and sufficient to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the
solution of our model. Our condition is the weakest in literature till now. We
implement various optimization algorithms to solve the model efficiently. We
test the practical effectiveness of our model by separately ranking 5 seasons of
publicly available National Football League (NFL) team data from 2011-2015, and
NASCAR 2002 racing data. In particular, our ranking results on the NFL data
compare favourably to the well-accepted and feature-rich NFL ELO ratings system.
We thus view our time-varying Bradley-Terry model as a useful benchmarking tool
for other feature-rich time-varying ranking models since it simply relies on the
minimal time-varying pairwise comparison results for modeling.

## Abstract

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality
worldwide, with approximately 12 million adults in the U.S. having been
diagnosed with COPD. Our aim is to develop methods capable of effectively
predicting cases of undiagnosed COPD among those whose primary reason for
hospitalization was pneumonia. Most existing algorithmic approaches to similar
prediction problems focus only on utilizing clinical information. Our approach,
however, aims to incorporate external environmental data sources that are not
captured by the clinical records using a process called “data blending”. We also
investigate several leading supervised machine learning algorithms including
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) to improve COPD classification accuracy. We find that smoking and
weather information significantly improve the predictive power of these
algorithms in terms of predicting COPD among pneumonia pa-tients.
