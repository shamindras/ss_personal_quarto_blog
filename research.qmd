I'm a final year PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Data
Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon
University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by
[Prof. Matey Neykov](http://mateyneykov.com/).

Broadly speaking my primary research interests lie in studying various
generalizations in classical statistics, and their theoretical properties,
through a modern lens.

My thesis covers topics including **density estimation, isotonic
regression,** and **location-scale estimation**. I'm also actively interested in
**statistical ranking** (in particular the *Bradley-Terry-Luce model*), and
**spatiotemporal modeling** (*wildfire prediction*).

I particularly enjoy the collaborative aspect of research, and I'm privileged to
work with the following brilliant people^[Listed alphabetically by surname. Go

I recommend just perusing some of my papers below to get a better idea of the
type of problems I like to work on, and the style of papers I enjoy writing with
my co-authors.

We study the classical problem of deriving minimax rates for density estimation
over convex density classes. Building on the pioneering work of Le Cam (1973),
Birge (1983, 1986), Wong and Shen (1995), Yang and Barron (1999), we determine
the exact (up to constants) minimax rate over any convex density class. This
work thus extends these known results by demonstrating that the local metric
entropy of the density class always captures the minimax optimal rates under
such settings. Our bounds provide a unifying perspective across both parametric
and nonparametric convex density classes, under weaker assumptions on the
richness of the density class than previously considered. Our proposed
'multistage sieve' MLE applies to any such convex density class. We apply our
risk bounds to rederive known minimax rates including bounded total variation,
and Holder density classes. We further illustrate the utility of the result by
deriving upper bounds for less studied classes, e.g., convex mixture of
densities.
